1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,029
this year we had the privilege of having
a third Hall speakers be women and that

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,150
the special thanks to just McKellar and
her average

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:17,150
which is fantastic

4
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,760
so once again if you enjoy talk please
let them now so they know

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,900
they did something wonderful to and
tomorrow

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,800
im um I'd also like to thank the path
and softer foundation

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,470
um the PSF axes basically financial
backer for this entire conference

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,059
so basically they're on the hook if
anything goes wrong I

9
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:42,110
which obviously having a sold-out crowd
three years in a row once again this

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,720
year

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,440
is seems like it's on a big deal
references when the recession hit

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,690
the PSF was the one they had to cover
expenses and stuff and this off as

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,390
planned

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,199
two three four years in advance so stuff
does happen so you want the PSF for

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,199
been landed take the financial risk of
keeping this conference going

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,780
um also I think the sponsors

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,540
arm if you don't know how expensive it
is to run a conference

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,270
is very expensive I the hobby is
consequences does not come close to

19
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,450
covering expenses and it's thanks to
sponsors

20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,990
both to the part that such permission
and sponsors here at the conference the

21
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,520
help keep the price low enough

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,680
so that students and hobbyists and
people who can get an employee

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,060
employer Dec to pay for them to come to
you will have to make this an affordable

24
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,170
conference compared to other companies
out there

25
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,300
and a special thanks to Justin all there
were areas

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,700
for Guinness 110 sponsors this year to
help make this conference possible

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,700
as SEO says:

28
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,900
some

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,510
this year we had a frame fantastic
amount of financial aid to help get

30
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,340
people here who can afford to come on
their own

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,630
%uh the PSF alone donated eighty
thousand dollars

32
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,330
to help fun people for tickets flights
hotels it after

33
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,850
arm I think the pie ladies who raised
forty thousand dollars to help get

34
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,660
people to come

35
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,780
and also thinks the pike on Australia
who also raised on their own three

36
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,050
thousand five hundred dollars

37
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,120
up so thank you to all them

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,200
and making sure we can have as many
people who can calm as possible regards

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,200
to their financial needs

40
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,150
so I'm gonna cover what's already
happened

41
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,460
a not to make you jealous but so that
hopefully all you have not been here

42
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,900
before will know when you when you miss
the next year

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,200
which I hope will be all you coming back

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,500
actually enjoy the conference the
morning you will this year

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,400
prompted start there's actually a group
love

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,410
Prime Minister's coming out from the
Triangle area on tobacco pipe on Rails

47
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,500
where they basically rented out a train

48
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,930
car from Toronto test too much out yes
but I other nonspecific it up

49
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm and the message just to train
together

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,800
on Thursday and it is all talked and
hung out oMG my wife and I took the

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,230
train was a fantastic experience the
runs one Lincoln Terrace gorgeous

52
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,550
are so few coming from the trainer or
honestly want to fly to Toronto

53
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,440
which is not hard and then take the
train with them next year would highly

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,030
recommend it

55
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,500
I am we had tutorials

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,730
all at once and Thursday there were 36
the alarm

57
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,920
attended by eight hundred pick some
people in

58
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,550
1,446 seats I receive very successful
year

59
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,090
hearts agree with the learned some
things and also the support the tutorial

60
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,030
speakers because

61
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,300
they're able to attend the conference
build-up I was asked if you did attend a

62
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,040
tutorial

63
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,370
please fill out the survey form for the
two trolls you attended

64
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,000
is uses the back for the tutorial
speakers for them to help improve their

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,040
farm Charles and such and it's very
invaluable Sopris dollars out but we had

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,930
the language some in

67
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,040
basically the loss on the court Obama
team get together every wednesday before

68
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,880
the conference

69
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,080
sit around and argue a

70
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,170
various things come up is one of the few
times there were wrecks are allowed to

71
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,360
sit down pat

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,820
as people face to face and discuss
things and have things out get updates

73
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,160
that

74
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,049
don't spam large trading stuff in very
productive as always and was meant as a

75
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:22,750
guide to do that

76
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,310
there's also an education summit
yesterday workers educators and

77
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,040
stakeholders were able to get together

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,340
attorney hope advanced Python and
education world

79
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,950
france is the huge push up the UK and
you simply raspberry PIs to help our

80
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,120
students learn in such small part about
something that's

81
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,880
going on today and tomorrow but that
doesn't really with sponsor chops the

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,840
past ones and there they were basically
sponsors had a chance to come in

83
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,960
and actually give you tutorial I know
how kinda sounds it sounds like it's

84
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,410
just a big pitch but I as the fuel to
the topic for actually useful on how to

85
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,570
actually use tools

86
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,130
how to use Python a unique way that
someone's also said you're so is a good

87
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,099
way to actually if you're here for
tutorials

88
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:06,440
to kinda feel time between them or if
you're only here for one to have the

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,990
next day

90
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,910
access something to do it without having
to pay for anything and make sure your

91
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,870
time to do through time

92
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,440
we also the opening reception yesterday

93
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,700
thief I went for sponsoring a proud I
had a good time and obviously you

94
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,770
the two free drink tickets helped a

95
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,960
was great also see all the sponsored up
there and who's using Python which is

96
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,510
growing every year and continues to
amaze me so that's what happened

97
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,669
so once again if you missed it come back
next year you can

98
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,310
do all that use of a comp up but here's
what you got looking for two today

99
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,440
Saturday and Sunday

100
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,820
for small we have a hundred talks this
year

101
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,460
across five tracks plus the keynotes
which i think is absolutely fantastic

102
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,260
I i believe i was told there are about
600 submissions

103
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,090
so as you can tell by that number there
was a huge amount competition this year

104
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,250
to try to get talks in

105
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,460
so I expect this will be a fantastic
conference once again

106
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,500
I do have some last-minute changes to
you

107
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,080

Lindsay's talk today at Every Phone

no those are the only changes in the
schedule at this point

114
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,610
I am

115
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,720
well we all get to sit around and talk
about Python and such throughout are the

116
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,630
next three days

117
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,520

119
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,750
this is something that started up icon

122
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,990
ever put your head in this room from the
past two years but if you haven't had

123
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,070
spent SEC's Kinsler makers

124
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,930
these are people blue kids angry under
the age of 18 you have never learned how

125
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,990
to program

126
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,900
city in there just wide-eyed like we all
once weren't going

127
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,990
wow look at what I can do and it's
fantastic to see

128
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,740
it sold out in Fort Lee so you brought
your kids I'm sorry

129
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,130
but you can sign up early hopefully next

130
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,380
they're going to be lightning talks this
year as usual if you don't let me talk

131
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,820
is basically

132
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,870
its up five-minute talk it's really fast
we get to the point

133
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,169
and the commuter lot of fun good luck
people do them on the spot

134
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,550
are this year though actually train a
kind of different thing where half the

135
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,710
talks were previously pitched

136
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,540
except in and other have gone with you
sign up arm the will be at the beginning

137
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,410
and end of each day except for the big
game today so it'll start the

138
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,699
and the today product and then every
morning before the conference starts

139
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:55,490
and every evening when the conference
and still be settling talks

140
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,960
I highly recommend attending they're
always on a fun there's always at least

141
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,270
several fantastic many talks that are
different person

142
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,639
we have open spaces every day during the
conference if you don't know the open

143
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,889
spaces

144
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,750
you can't kinda think it was a
self-organized aspect to the conference

145
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,930
you can basically

146
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,540
reserve a room for at least half an hour
and you can you there

147
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,290
present something you can get together
with like minded people have a

148
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,190
discussion

149
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,590
it's completely up to you there's a
board bleed Emerson

150
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,330
are they can go sign up for room and
just newsroom for whatever you need to

151
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,959
to everyone I'm

152
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,699
with the first this year we actually
have child care for those you traveling

153
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:38,360
with children

154
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,130
rides every day this year I I suspect if
the reception is good will bring it back

155
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,940
so hopefully if you didn't bring your
family this year because

156
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,220
