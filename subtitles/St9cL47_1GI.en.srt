1
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,030
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,990
now we have my friend Julian palette
with from San Francisco

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,730
and he'll be talking about and Mon
techniques for babbitt function testing

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:16,690
Union thank you

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,320
thanks everyone for coming today

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,140
I'm gonna start just very briefly don't
want to bore you with that

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,260
just couple facts about me so you know
why I'm here today I've been happily

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,769
programming with by phone as my main
language

9
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:34,840
for a number of years I am also a joke
or commuter

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,329
and I occasionally tweet from this
handle sure

11
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,790
ever interest in what I have to say I

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,030
work at near on we are aware the agency

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,180
with a few offices ass gathered

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,699
scattered around the world I'm
personally based in San Francisco but we

15
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:52,399
also have

16
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,629
and his here in Montreal and we do

17
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,719
require carry encourage you to check out
our web site or commencing after talking

18
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,510
to a lecture on

19
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,640
more about us okay so

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,710
starting with a few definitions just so
we're clear on why

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,250
I'm gonna be talking about why we talk
about

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,070
many testing it is to ensure that small
part of our code

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,170
each work in isolation integration
testing is about ensuring that

24
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,650
some other spots when combined together
keep working well

25
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,650
and then functional testing is wants to
be on his 21 make sure they are you

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,049
happy occasion as a whole

27
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,020
functions well a in particular from the
user's perspective

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,320
and one we do believe

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,640
functional testing for the web typically
it comes

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,409
down to using Brotherhood two meters now
why would be using

31
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:53,229
Abruzzo tomatoes first because heat
brings us closer to real when his

32
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,040
environment

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,689
all the media on study files such as CSS
images et cetera the old automatically

34
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,090
get looted by the bra so you don't have
to worry about any of that and semi

35
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,530
naughty

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,140
any JavaScript code any a just calls
implicitly get

37
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,319
executed by the brosser and then when
all that is put together than

38
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,750
allows you to test use interactions
browser compatibility

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,890
and very importantly it's a lot of fun
now

40
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,690
the the most put my second most popular

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,769
have web a brother to me they're out
there these days is silly name

42
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,110
I was actually curious today a who

43
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,700
a ok you have ever you silly names to
could raise your hand

44
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,050
well thats clearly the majority that's

45
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,440
exciting I really hope that as you look
at the stock actually

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,800
learned a lot of new tricks so silly
name

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,660
very briefly in pain as they were driver
API which is about to become the

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,260
WC w3c standoff and is currently in
draft

49
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,659
he works across multiple browsers for
example Firefox Chrome IE

50
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:05,930
Safari an Oprah he has

51
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,190
trying to have a reason for sanguinis in
particular by phone that's what we're

52
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,940
interested in

53
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,489
on it's very easy to install you just
round peep in store sitting in a few go

54
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:17,690
so for those of you who

55
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,989
do not know that Selena for just give a
very quick the known

56
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,120
just to get an idea of the kinds of
things that he can do with it

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,370
and so here it is going to run

58
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,110
I a subset of the Django admin

59
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,569
te Street which is for a return with
synonym I'm gonna be holding my hand

60
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:35,950
serbs

61
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,560
so you know 90s a automated I'm not
going to do anything and everything is

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,709
gonna be running by itself

63
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,590
what's going to happen is that you will
see honest answer Firefox that we open

64
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,099
and then a bunch of views are action
being executed

65
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:53,569
in an automated way so he received
Firefox is running

66
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:56,930
running a bunch of user action is so
going very fast

67
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,269
and hear Tpke we using

68
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,069
selenium in Django mostly to test the
fracture eighty

69
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,340
so that means a form submissions

70
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,340
for submissions and JavaScript any a

71
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,280
little JavaScript admits that help
improved experience

72
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,049
in the Django admin so we which one have
some test to make sure that as we keep

73
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:23,130
adding more code power to Java scripps
or even and

74
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,430
I think ok sometimes just make sure that
a

75
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,530
everything keeps working that there are
no regression overtime

76
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,229
so that's it's

77
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:36,370
just to give you an idea of the
cannister you can do with synonym

78
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,259
now than I thought

79
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,820
I show she think that may not
necessarily be ok just one start using

80
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,160
Selenium

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,770
are shoot for simple you you you've
created responsive web sites

82
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,000
which responsiveness something that's
become really popular in the last couple

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
years and for good reasons

84
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,860
because with a single code base you can
do

85
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,699
display content optimally for various
screen sizes for example for mobile or

86
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,150
desktop a tablet

87
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,100
now testing you what said was him
sexually read really simple

88
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,669
you know comes down to using that one
method which comes in that which are

89
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:12,740
very PI

90
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,729
said window size which allows you chew
at any point in time during your test to

91
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,509
resize the browser window

92
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:21,520
and then for example you may stop a
we've

93
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,630
a 6-under be so we'd run some tests make
sure everything works for mobile

94
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,080
and then expand the window size to then
ran some test

95
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,789
to ensure they are worse on desktop and
I just had a very simple devotion here

96
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:34,990
again

97
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,330
I to do that actually used the by

98
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,600
Khan which site wish which I'm sure
you've all used

99
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,940
and interacted with I'm just country
running it

100
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,570
locally to its it actually happens to be
a genocide to

101
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,910
and issued here at the top for example
there's a menu which you can expand its

102
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,310
very

103
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,650
no traditional Canada interaction and
she resize the browser

104
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,330
that mean you will hide behind that I
can he run down can expand it

105
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,569
and then again interact with the same
menu

106
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,620
SAR wrote a very simple test

107
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,750
to make sure that this works fine

108
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,039
and again opening automatically comes up

109
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,710
to were to magically openly a a

110
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,930
and two bras are a

111
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,530
opening each other's menus and then
resizing the window using that method

112
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,509
aunt checking the that many works on
mobile says very straightforward

113
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,870
something that just may not be totally
obvious

114
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,060
once you start easing synonym

115
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,229
so that was very quick Dino now
something that's

116
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,699
and i think is very very calm he is that
you can also test

117
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:47,180
no need a fresh I ET so you're just
repetition you can also tested visuals

118
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,130
so you CSS images et cetera anything
that would be

119
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,720
visually rendered on your page and that
can be done with a nifty little

120
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,479
perhaps that's corny don't I it's
available to get her to study but men

121
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,470
freshman and I

122
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,729
it turned out that I call to help
maintain

123
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:08,830
it's based on synonym and he we catch

124
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,870
any regressions Ian the displayed

125
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,009
of your site by for example there may be
lost I saw your CSS typography is VG

126
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:17,949
images

127
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,199
basically anything that would be
visually represented on a site

128
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,520
and he would do that by actually taking
screenshots an

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,620
comparing x-men shot over time andy
field sports

130
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,910
any any differences between dispensers
ninety would sell

131
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,229
with her a standard test failure

132
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:39,289
so a just to give you a very quick
example minutes

133
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:43,280
extremely simple to use I again I'm
gonna use

134
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,509
I the bike on which side as a as a an
example

135
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:53,069
here I'm interesting in that a nice lead
a banner here he has some cool graphics

136
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:56,289
some nice colors on the also has some
text in it

137
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:00,569
so how would we go about writing some
test to make sure that Dez

138
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:04,889
visual keeps looking the same over time
as we keep making changes

139
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,910
in a CSS just make sure we never
introduce any regressions

140
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,229
and only takes is that really done one
method a sub screenshots

141
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:17,500
which comes with which is provided by
nato

142
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,039
so what he does that too thats cumshot a
suspension method

143
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,080
accepts to parameters the first one is a
CSS selector to

144
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,860
the element on your page if you wanna a
target and take a screenshot

145
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,899
of the second parameter ease

146
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,200
charges that define name that's going to
be stored buttock ng5

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,620
a screenshot is going east on your on
your disk

148
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,860
and divers first time you gonna run this
test is gonna pass in a flag

149
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,660
at which going to instruct needle check
she say the baseline

150
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,540
kokia the screenshot and every
subsequent times that you run a test for

151
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,980
example on CSR

152
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,320
you we're under stairs without that
flight was going to do so is going to

153
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,660
take a new strain showed and compare it
with

154
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,959
the Best Animated you've previously
created

155
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,959
so I'm gonna do you agree to something
can

156
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:20,290
so it's a it's a very first time going
to church

157
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,980
for the clear K

158
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,940
so the very first anime running be so
I'm gonna pass it

159
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,930
that flag save Beistline

160
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,329
so it's gonna run that that Co data to
show you

161
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:40,410
tremendously bigger Mary she can see arm

162
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,820
okay

163
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,730
so running a test so now you see it
opens Firefox

164
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,950
knows the leukocyte take a screenshot

165
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,970
all very fast knife we take a look here

166
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,350
it's created for their with that one

167
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,670
a screenshot so it's all well and good
so far

168
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,800
a particularly useful I'm just gonna run
the test again now without this flag

169
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,040
what's gonna happen now is out again is
gonna do exactly the same thing

170
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,980
has gone open the page dated take a
screenshot compared with the baseline

171
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,329
that previously created the end it
detect any difference she so desperate

172
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:24,060
now let's go in into the code and insert
a mistake

173
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,209
a I'm just gonna chance here

174
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,610
accidentally a the call of the blue sky

175
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,350
an inverse it away here instead of five
I was going to put a zero

176
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,649
if

177
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:43,300
I reload the page here its

178
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,430
ok it's really hard to see that

179
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,670
anything challenge to just look at it
you know it premature the same very easy

180
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,370
to miss that

181
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,660
within so did that the tape a window
into CSS

182
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,029
but this is where need to consider risky
so

183
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:03,140
here I'm going to rerun that same test
setting up as a brother a Texas man shot

184
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,199
compares it with a baseline and it's
time to test the test failed

185
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:14,350
for you go back up you see the research
for the newsprint show about a bad in

186
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,890
much the best night but its

187
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,260
doesn't just stop there he would
actually also create a defiant between

188
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,380
been used when showed on the best time
check Chile highlight

189
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,959
what actually one wrong where did you
the differences so he created and if I

190
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,490
had been ordered beefed-up Angie

191
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,640
and here actually highlights what's
basically different agenda baseline in

192
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,050
the screenshot so here

193
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,360
it's obvious that there's something
wrong with the the the Scottish and a

194
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,839
car

195
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:49,050
so damn gonna go back in here on and do
my mistake

196
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,910
rear under test

197
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,310
another test passed

198
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,940
another another very common mistake

199
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,600
when dealing with CSS is one missing up
fun sizes

200
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,110
so here again another example on going
to change the font size

201
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:15,110
for some other text in a banner and then
we run that test

202
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:22,310
my hair done test failed

203
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,730
for Luke again now that the file aids

204
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,640
the text actually changed within a
banner fits

205
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,050
extremely simple to use and its read a
really powerful

206
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:41,050
alrighty so now just to show your down

207
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,800
if I'm doing mistake here and I put it
back to what it used to be

208
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,319
and run a test there now

209
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:54,490
we back on track okay so moving on

210
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,290
I am 22

211
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:03,140
few a few tips about you know the best
lines control tacky actus fixtures

212
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,940
for you to street to typically want to
store them in your repository so that

213
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,390
their ship with the rest on your team
and the CA server

214
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,420
so that everybody can run a test against
the as baseline

215
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,529
screenshots it's awesome extremely
important to ensure the consistency

216
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,449
between

217
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,740
a different environments Heath a

218
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,399
the CA server uses a different browser
version or has different system trance

219
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,430
in store for example

220
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,589
the page Minot render exactly the same
so you wanna be very careful

221
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:34,550
I that or environment sector use the
same and I can be done using

222
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,380
configuration management systems like a
share fanciful puppet or salt

223
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,520
than I wanted to touch in topeka

224
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,069
continous integration how to you use all
this stuff

225
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,880
in the real workroom so when you gonna
be

226
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,730
a raining a sea ice are typically letter
is not gonna be using

227
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,160
a a physical monitor so instead you want
to

228
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,970
run your testing headless told which
means basically using a virtual display

229
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,559
very simple to do on your says however
you want install a

230
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,230
her brother is possible very specific
version of the riser

231
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,089
you want to stall and all system fonts
anything we need to make sure that

232
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:17,740
no consistency between your environment
and then you won't install

233
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,189
Expedia which she's a program that we're
on

234
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:24,760
a dual display memory:

235
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,550
that is very simple to use again randy
is VBS command and then assign a number

236
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,910
for that displayed a stand gonna be used
by your browser

237
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,990
if you use Jenkins you can also use a XP
bf again

238
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,930
that's basically gone around us two
things for you were too much cream

239
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,250
for you every time to test around she's
Travis sitter

240
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,660
also very simple use does run this
comments before your test actually start

241
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,809
you can also use by their choice pay
which is nice little package

242
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,890
which will allow its military
wrap-around text PDF any will allow you

243
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,160
to start and stop

244
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,990
that there to display using passion code

245
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,069
or you may also use ban on JS which is a

246
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,260
headless brosser as gonna deal with its
own virtually spay

247
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,439
it's a super easy to use a silly me in
sheep's

248
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:14,470
a an interface to dad browser

249
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,220
so it's it very easy just get started
with

250
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,189
so wanting to show a very quick service
that his cock also slabs

251
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,260
and what's a slut does it actually runs

252
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,279
I remote in the cloud has a whole bunch
of different VMs

253
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,510
and what's really nice is that he
actually gives access to multiple

254
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,760
different browsers

255
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,829
tonight I year 54 scrimmage any any
brushes can think of

256
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:42,760
even including mobile processors and
that saves you the trouble

257
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,380
of eat managing your own a set of

258
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,279
no different environment different
browsers locally

259
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,709
also allow us to run tests in parallel
and something's really useful we also

260
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:57,819
keeps video recordings of all the
sessions that you run

261
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:01,579
it's six particularly useful one test
actually fail to see can go back and it

262
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:02,559
a point in time

263
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,079
and look at the video to see where test
actually failed

264
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,050
so hearing I'm gonna show a deal

265
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,949
I I'm gonna run I am

266
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:18,209
some other gender test to show their
earlier this time

267
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:22,100
only this time a remotely on this to
slap

268
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,260
platform

269
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:33,260
just realized I am actually have to
restart a server cedar

270
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:41,760
to spare with me for a second

271
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,000
here what I'm doing physically stirred
create the initial connection with the

272
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,040
source web server

273
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,579
just make sure everything is of

274
00:16:54,579 --> 00:17:01,579
frantic aged

275
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:23,230
came

276
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,560
sahnoun going around does test

277
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:33,100
okay it's an on going to go to lead us a
slam website

278
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:40,100
refresh

279
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,840
so now you see that some tests are
currently being run can actually see

280
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,390
them

281
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:53,390
in real time so you can see the test
around I speech

282
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,580
in a performance that I was very quick
one and the cool thing is at it again

283
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,690
eater a video recording of that test or
any point in time to go back

284
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,570
and then view the video in this
particular instance I'm running does

285
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,559
gender tests

286
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,390
on I think Firefox on a Linux machine

287
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:21,390
yet

288
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,570
and that same test which I have been
running

289
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:34,570
on I think I E eight yes

290
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:40,320
midst try yessir dads

291
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,299
I E eight on a on it Windows XP machine
again it's just currently being run

292
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:51,509
so he can

293
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,580
just a YouTube video

294
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,370
so why I'm currently have been trying to
integrate into Django te Street

295
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,470
we've passos Lasker there there can you
know try to provide a sour

296
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,350
and a an account for us for open source
projects and

297
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,850
ISO we're just now in the process of
integrating the whole test route is

298
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,220
going to be very useful to ensure that
the gentleman's

299
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,220
keeps working in all different kinds a
process K

300
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,820
sorry I encourage you to check him out

301
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,980
it's it's a case it's very handy
especially if you don't have to do with

302
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,519
the trouble

303
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,490
dealing with all those environments
yourself a photo so touch

304
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,279
on a topic thats a beat controversial
when selling your own car

305
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:37,299
sammy's often criticized for I it's
known as in shaking ass

306
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:40,909
really there should be a target of
dedicated to this

307
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:44,490
I their solutions for but just about
everything but it does require

308
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,080
some effort I just thought I would to
provide a few quick tips

309
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,259
for some moisture really concerned about
ski to encourage you to use fat NGS cuz

310
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,230
it's much more lightweight and Firefox
any

311
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,639
him we were in much faster ice encourage
you to use paralyze a sham

312
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:01,669
action actually can show you an example
here

313
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,730
I'm gonna run some tests I'm gonna

314
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:09,649
stud the social at taps test here camden
around some other test data showed you

315
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:10,440
earlier

316
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,929
only jean-juste a multiple

317
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:17,120
processes at a time that's a future
that's provided by nosed

318
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,299
a knows this run our school that s
runners also have this kind of russian

319
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:21,740
teen

320
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,799
where you gonna see here is multiple
versus

321
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,350
instances a Firefox running at the same
time in each

322
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,190
each running a different test said
that's going to you

323
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,570
a reedy speed up the

324
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:40,970
did the time education time with your
test and so again very easy to use

325
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,169
now actually concerned about robustness

326
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:49,139
II can exercise this enough it's really
really important to pin down versions of

327
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,519
the whole software stack

328
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,690
there is so much so much stuff happening
when you run factional test because it

329
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,200
exercise its so many

330
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,870
laser of your software stack its report
and that

331
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,929
I everybody on your team in NCAA servers
using directly the same versions

332
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,320
all the ways any subtle differences
between to her shower software

333
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,059
may caused a did bring a you would say
to you

334
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:14,490
behave or look slightly differently and
then cause I

335
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,019
a false positive in presences in your
apt issued

336
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:23,899
extremely important also you want to
master the use of explicit wait it's a

337
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:24,710
very common

338
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,110
salsa mistakes when writing singing test

339
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,700
a a very common mistakes actually to run
your test too fast

340
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,340
be forwarded to state in the browser is
reached for this test to be run

341
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,299
so you wanna make sure of i suppose you
have a very long Ajax course being run

342
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,039
you wanna have

343
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,110
ways of tracking that a

344
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,029
the the web app he's at a stage where
you can continuing your test

345
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:51,110
and the whips driver API I gives you

346
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,299
the kind of functionality to test for
particular condition

347
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:58,090
on for you to wait on and then resume
your test

348
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,460
that already goes a long way into
increasing robustness on your test

349
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,169
but it does require to be me for the
call and and meticulous

350
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:09,450
and there are a lot more cheats a

351
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,350
that I don't have time to call for today
but I encourage you to check out those

352
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,549
two books which are

353
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:17,820
both really useful I'll I shared links
in induced when a publisher site

354
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,070
the size area later on those are really
should have

355
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,960
really good tips for increasing
efficiency a test so

356
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,639
in conclusion I 20 a

357
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:33,700
what a question integration fashion test
are slow that's an obvious fact

358
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,159
to use them with moderation you should
also only you silly and for why did Demi

359
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,480
test time anal

360
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,369
already achieved so focus your singing
test on complex use our workflows for

361
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:45,570
example or visuals

362
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,720
and let the dummy try and take care of
everything else cuz it's gonna be much

363
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,039
faster much more reliable

364
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:55,330
and finally integration and fashion test
are important I really encourage you to

365
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,879
include some in yo te street because
stay we'll

366
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:01,080
increase you can finance in your code
greatly

367
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,960
there when Craig increase your test
coverage

368
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,450
that will increase iron added that will
allow you to test

369
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,149
the interaction between a friend on your
back and ensure that the user interface

370
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:15,570
works and looks as a spit expected

371
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,929
and its is again it's a lot of fun to
use down through and

372
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:22,129
if you've never used it I really
encourage you to use the stools

373
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:26,570
because at the very least you're just
gonna have a lot of fun

374
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,809
thanks very much for listening and i'm
happy to answer any question

375
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:36,809
you may have

376
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,730
we have time for a question and answers
do you have any questions

377
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,510
on Union am so just one very quick
question

378
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,029
and you mentioned and ask for had less

379
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:52,450
testing of course given that JavaScript
tends to work very differently in

380
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,400
different browsers

381
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,299
am have you got any suggestions for

382
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,620
headless versions of other browsers like
Firefox or I'm

383
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,179
well

384
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,730
Tpke when using and headless mode I
would

385
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,740
use a virtual display so we could still
use the same and

386
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,029
engine is possible I as far as find OJ's
his concern actually really impressed by

387
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:16,649
how

388
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:20,500
robust an efficient and easy it's pretty
much on par with

389
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,690
Firefox and Chrome in terms of
Franchitti at least as far as as far as

390
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,720
I've been testing it

391
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,980
and it something actually use very

392
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,870
confidently with my test I really
recommend you to check it out super easy

393
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,500
to install and spurs EU's

394
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,500
I thanks very much for talking

395
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,669
I learned a lot am a so just a tiny
little thing really I'm case you didn't

396
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:45,049
know it

397
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,220
as they a command it comes to the latest
versions of XP FB called

398
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,470
XP FB dash from which will just run the
next money put in bash

399
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,230
in a virtual frame buffer is really
useful even on your own machine if

400
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,520
you're running slinging tests

401
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,440
that they'll be in a federal crime
office and are popping up an annoying

402
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,520
you literally something else

403
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,890
has a ex bf b-12 compaq's I'd

404
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,940
thanks for the talk but that is really
interesting I just was wondering if you

405
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,340
could comment on how you decide what to
test

406
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,510
like would you test the basic path
through your app

407
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,850
or edge cases Mar so

408
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,080
I mean it's a common problem you have
with test in general

409
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,090
you know you could spaniel days you know
writing tests and that's that so good

410
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,600
but

411
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,610
you you really want think about what's
really critical what's really important

412
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,010
but really make sense to Fannie really
differs from a

413
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,279
website to website with that's where
maps if you have to raise up on top that

414
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,820
it's extremely crucial that something
looks pixel perfect

415
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,549
all the ways you up one may can stand
stand is something that will

416
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,780
definitely makes ass too would you want
put some effort

417
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,409
into I using you know sitting in for
example

418
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:56,230
East it's not that important the way it
looks if it breaks a little ways no big

419
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,110
deal done

420
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,549
don't worry about a senior and again you

421
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:03,860
saying you should be can have your last
resort always think

422
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,419
how can I achieve a this test using
something like a demitasse client

423
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:14,380
if I can then don't even look at synonym
are you sitting in for what you contest

424
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,080
with anything else and for something
that's really important for you and

425
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,510
Europe

426
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,710
yeah

427
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:28,179
thanks to talk is ur the way to evaluate
what code has been

428
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:32,299
executed on your murmur yes

429
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,960
you can use the coverage package which
we basically

430
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,970
least every line a code in your entire
stack

431
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,870
that's been executed during the test and
that that definitely works with sterling

432
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,320
%um

433
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:51,260
yet if it ends in the same process
that's right

434
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,450
so if everything runs in multiple
threads within the same process

435
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,250
you work note each it's raining magical
process that's a good point

436
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,490
I thank you for the presentation

437
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,059
how does sauce labs are even to let him
handle

438
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,770
data-driven web site so for example if
you need us there's some sort of an Ajax

439
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,429
grady that gets the database

440
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:15,760
a value from here from the from the dow
and

441
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,169
and then matches against it so how does
it handle that as a general

442
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:24,399
the values by itself are d have to
provide those values

443
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,809
are does there need to be a database
connection for that so as far as I

444
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:29,520
understand

445
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,120
processing actually happens a

446
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,909
so every any custom code any database
related code we're on

447
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:40,649
locally so it's a on your see a server
or on your laptop

448
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:43,929
associated with just only take care of
the rendering

449
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,590
and exiting of and whatever JavaScript
inside

450
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,840
that VM but then you wish to communicate
with your local app

451
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,389
as far as datas concern for example so
that means deliveries needs to get

452
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:59,580
accessible for sauce labs no to you

453
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,020
to do that I know as far as they're
concerned a that

454
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,120
only needs to be eat that we only be
executed

455
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,909
on your machine and then he will just
Soundarya basically DHTML in the

456
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:11,700
resulting

457
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,620
I did the resolve your up would be dance
and over to social and that would be

458
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,210
rendered

459
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:20,929
so it heard so sad only takes care of
the client side basically

460
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:24,240
I C thanks as a that they have like um

461
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,720
if you're running serves locally they
have a lil encrypt a tunnel at No

462
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,870
but between your machine so you wanna
proxy server on your machine yeah

463
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,860
and I'll tunnel over to the source a
service they can look and if you go

464
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,720
running locally or on your network

465
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,840
that's right this is this is the thing
that I was running that took a minute to

466
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,030
to get started earlier

467
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,830
how to use the Lord multiple different
browsers if you're trying to do visual

468
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,379
testing in Internet Explorer

469
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:49,530
say 6 because one kill yourself

470
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:55,169
yeah hey a it's very easy actually you
just need to use a different

471
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:59,639
you know it's up to you they're there to
KC that's a he he really care

472
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:04,429
that both process a Firefox and IE six
would render

473
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:07,480
a particular component on your page
exactly the same

474
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,659
than you wanna test against the same
baseline image

475
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:14,399
issue a acknowledge that there may be
differences they're not

476
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,990
so important but you do want to make
sure that a key sparking the same and I

477
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,610
E

478
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,590
keeps working the same Firefox than just
create two different sets of baseline

479
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,530
images

480
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,590
to you can you know maybe have a class
that we inherit from your

481
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,809
say and I eat s-class that we inherit
from Thai folks

482
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:34,049
Iran exactly the same tessick said you
switch

483
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:37,830
the the webdriver and you just give you
know different fine Amos

484
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,289
so they don't conflict X

485
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:45,470
right demolition

486
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,460
both them for the Don Julian thank you
you have a couple of time
