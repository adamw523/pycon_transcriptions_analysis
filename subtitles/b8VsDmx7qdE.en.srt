1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,109
right good morning everyone i'm so
welcome to for soccer today

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,190
I am please give a hand for speaker just
a a

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,889
Jessica hamrick who will be talking
about games work science

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,150
creating interactive psychology
experiments in Python with

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:25,150
Penner's 3d thank you

6
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:29,289
am one

7
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:36,289
ask so

8
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,980
I'm so yes I I I'm a registered

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,040
at UC berkeley and I'm gonna be talking
about some research that i've done with

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,539
my colleague Peter Italia

11
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,180
who is research scientist at MIT and
unfortunately couldn't be here up icon

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,090
amber has been like I really enter a
part of this research he was my mentor I

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,750
was an undergraduate at MIT

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,760
and actually I'll be talking about an
experiment that he's done since I left

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,460
and I T

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,460
on so to start out with am

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,170
first let's talk a little bit about
games so the Rams have

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,830
and become increasingly popular recently
as irv

19
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,260
May 2012 apparently Angry Birds had been
played

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,040
a total of 200,000 to get two hundred
thousand years

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,280
an with an average of 300 million
minutes

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
a playing time every single day I'm
which is a pretty big number

23
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,670
our TVs and how big it is am their 109
minutes is approximately equal to five

24
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,970
hundred and seventy years

25
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,970
so thats five hundred seventy years of
playing time

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,619
I'm just for Angry Birds every single
day

27
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:44,630
I am at the huge amount of human efforts
and time that's being invested into this

28
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,479
one game

29
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,460
so wouldn't it be cool if we could
leverage that popularity

30
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,149
in order to do science I we could do so
much science

31
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:58,469
if we had that much manpower I'm so
that's the idea behind this talk is

32
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,110
doing you're creating fun games in order
to do interesting science

33
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,409
and to give you an outline have 1 I'll
be talking to you about

34
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,039
I'm first gonna go over the research
question our interested in at all then

35
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,780
tell you what our hypothesis is

36
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,540
that we think is going on on and I'll
tell you about the experiments that

37
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,330
we've run

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,420
I in order to test this hypothesis out
and it was that we used to make those

39
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,120
experiments

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,450
and you know the

41
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,340
the tools that we do you spend his
experiments they're not too difficult to

42
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,239
use I think anyone in this room

43
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,280
would be able to pick them up but fairly
easily we have some Democrats online

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,330
am you can go and look at it and so

45
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,800
I know have in mind for the talk it this
is interesting to you

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,550
you could probably do something pretty
similar if you wanna on

47
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,340
but aggressive for small with a question
are interested in so

48
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,730
we're fundamental interested in how
people reason about the world

49
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,280
and a particular have little reason
about the physical world so

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,930
from the time that you get up in the
morning and tell you go into work you

51
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,760
party interacted with the physical world

52
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,519
in ways that no computer can even begin
to rival so you got up

53
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,040
you made breakfast got dressed I am you
put things into your back you have to

54
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,459
work

55
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,060
a computer can do any of those things
well I S maybe they can

56
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,190
you know drive now with the growth of
driving car but

57
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,200
a computer I can do all those things
that I can't do it as fluidly

58
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,959
and it's like the way if people can and
so you might think well maybe that is

59
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,440
because we have a lot of experience but
the world you know if

60
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,739
you get up and make breakfast every
morning so you just you know easy

61
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:28,790
because he do it every day

62
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,599
but I think that our ability to reason
about physics is much more flexible a

63
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,510
much more powerful than that I'm going
to try to convince you of that

64
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,700
I could show you eight people with some
blacks on it

65
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,299
you probably never seen this table
before or this particular configuration

66
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:42,879
a box

67
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,010
yet if I told you to imagine that know
maybe there's some kids running around

68
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,440
and they bump into the table some box of

69
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,590
you probably have a pretty strong idea
have watch

70
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,599
colorblock is more likely to fall off so
I'm to shout out what you think

71
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,530
do think it's rather yellows more likely
to fall off right

72
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,560
act right how about this one Brett K

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
that's what I red the Sun

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,040
maybe me lol huh how this one

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,330
yellow okay this %uh red

76
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,359
right so you know just promised you seem
to never seen these before I get

77
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,600
you all have a pretty no strong opinion
about what might happen

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,360
and in general you agree with each other
you know the level of agreement

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,460
no can vary from scene to scene but it
seems like that's produced

80
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,120
there's something pretty systematic
comments really powerful flexible

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,240
reasoning going on

82
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,090
and so this is exactly the thing that
we're interested in is how is it that we

83
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,270
can reason about these tapes

84
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,100
scenes I think that's really interesting
am so that's a question

85
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,479
is how people be done about the physical
world I'm so then

86
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,040
now I'm gonna tell you about what our
hypothesis is that going on

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,470
so on they feel that a man is called
computational cognitive science

88
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,290
and in computational cognitive science
review the brain as a computer

89
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,580
I and we're interested in how the brain
generates thought behavior

90
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,639
and a particular and publication of
cognitive science

91
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,620
we are interested in how the brain
software works so how to suffer prison

92
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,350
behavior

93
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,520
our colleagues and computational
neuroscience are interested in the

94
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,229
hardware that's more like the individual
neurons

95
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:21,060
and so our scientific approach is to you
come up with the reserve how the

96
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,759
the mines software producers thought
behavior and then instantiate those

97
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,259
theories in a computer model

98
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,550
I'm so that might be a robot or
artificial intelligence but it's

99
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,590
something that can produce behavior just
like people countries behavior

100
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,820
and then we can compare the behavior
that the model produces with

101
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,520
up the beer that people produce after
the test our series and fine-tune them

102
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,960
and come to a better understanding of
how people think so

103
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,190
how do we create a model up how people
reason about physics

104
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,740
well luckily for us there's already a
lot a software that does PhysX

105
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,449
so for example the physics engine and a
video games like Angry Birds

106
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,740
on and moreover you know if read take a
look at his X Games The Sims offer us a

107
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,669
really nice platform for studying

108
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,919
have arisen about his ex because it
requires the same

109
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,509
you know types reasoning faculties that
you need to interact with the everyday

110
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:08,340
world

111
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,520
on so this is rated you know were
restarted what you're thinking about

112
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,740
and retook this you know pretty far in
what we hypothesize that you actually

113
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,620
have a physics engine

114
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,610
in your head I'm so you look at the
scene you form a representation over in

115
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,500
your mind

116
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,639
and then your mind actually performs a
simulation

117
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,680
have you know simulating for the future
together outcome

118
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,310
you can use that how come to make a
decision about something in the world

119
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,710
and and there's two components that have
high pop says the first is that

120
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,160
this is a vengeance approximate meaning
that assimilation that runs aren't

121
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,300
exact and the second is that its
probabilistic

122
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,590
meaning that if you run the same
simulation twice you make it a slightly

123
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,340
different

124
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,289
answer and the reason for these two and
components

125
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:55,460
I'm is because the world has uncertainty
at the for example I could show you

126
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,750
this picture up these rocks which you
might think maybe was taken just at the

127
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,009
moment they're about to fall

128
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:04,229
or perhaps in photoshopped by actually

129
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:08,639
it neither does a a real photo that's
taken every of stable

130
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,479
structures this is a sports car rock
balancing and the goal is to build these

131
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,710
crazy structures that look like they're
going to fall down

132
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,130
I'm its prequel a but you know

133
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,280
if you're actually stable but we all
have this impression that this must

134
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,650
be about to fall down you know our model
needs to be able to

135
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,120
account for that and so we think that
you know you take so many coincidences

136
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,660
I am for the structured actually be
stable that are mine says

137
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,819
that you know a combination of
confidence is so unlikely

138
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,610
that anger into you know said probably
going to be unstable

139
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,120
rather than assuming E all these prints
dances are gonna happen

140
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,099
and so that's sorta important you know
approximate published a component

141
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,660
I can handle these types on certain
situations I we can extend it beyond

142
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,569
rock balancing

143
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,340
to maybe a tower blocks again Jenga

144
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,919
order to a a 3d model Anna physical
stimulation

145
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,819
like the tape that we're on our
experiments as it is is the actual

146
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,810
stimulus from our experiments

147
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,669
that am is actually stable but it looks
very unstable all of our participants

148
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:11,900
always say that unstable I and I

149
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,979
our model also says that its unstable
because I had this approximate published

150
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,830
a component

151
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,300
so I'm the reason why we take a physics
engine is a good idea is the same reason

152
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,500
why it's a good idea in games and
graphics

153
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,870
so first bought it affective like it can
produce simulations that are

154
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,310
sufficiently realistic to fool you into
thinking that it's you know

155
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,050
at you know not if maybe not a real
scenario but

156
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,459
no good depiction ever else now it
sufficient

157
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:43,219
so it's made to run in real time
similarly the you know for the engineer

158
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:45,709
had has to be able to run in real time
you can't just sit around all day

159
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,860
waiting for your simulations to complete

160
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,140
before you know you make a judgment
about some seen I'm

161
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,269
and then finally and I think this is the
most important one is I have to be

162
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,350
general purpose

163
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,350
so are the fecundity your hat has to be
able to apply to many different types of

164
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,450
situations

165
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,890
because the last thing that you'd watch
is to encounter situation

166
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,370
but you didn't have experience with and
not know how to act so

167
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,589
apparently this is a sign somewhere in
the United States am

168
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:14,600
if you look closely an you'll see that I
guess it's a little dark

169
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,160
a sorry but this is a not rockets a cow

170
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,240
so apparently some where the United
States is the danger

171
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,529
house falling off a cliff fun to your
car I'm

172
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,670
I hopefully not if you have been in this
situation an

173
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,670
but if you were in this situation I I'm
pretty confident that you'll be able to

174
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,899
do something reasonable

175
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,709
and you know deal with this thing area
despite the fact that you've never been

176
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,350
in that area before

177
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,399
so there's a ability to reason about
things that you know we've never

178
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,839
experienced is really really important

179
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,380
am so you know that sort of motivation
behind why we think this is engine

180
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,420
idea is a good it's a good idea

181
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,000
okay so that's our hypothesis the
physics engine in your head

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,180
i'm for now I'll finally we can get to
the actual experiments that we ran

183
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,310
on so good you know

184
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,880
the way that we are going to test this
is by taking

185
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,290
the and two other people have used to
make video games

186
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,240
and actually use them both as our
theories so we can use the physics

187
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,050
engines from his game as a period how
people reason about physics

188
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,640
on and we can use it to create is really
rich and engaging experience

189
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,820
I'm so our general research pipeline
goes like this:

190
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,500
first we can create a computational
model and you redo that using a video

191
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,540
game physics engine

192
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,519
for example bullet am then we can
generate stimuli detached

193
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,529
are model and also people

194
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm using a 3d modeling program like
blunder and then we can run experiments

195
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,140
using a video game framework like Panda
3d at all three of these trolls that I

196
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,290
mentioned are

197
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,019
open source they'll have python bindings
out so they fit really nicely together

198
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,870
they work really well together

199
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,070
I'm and it fits into the larger picture
of Python and science as well because

200
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,110
we can do all over data analysis using
umpires type II

201
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,890
et cetera and then rehab is really nice
powerful framework for doing research

202
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,079
all the way from the level of creating a
model to running experiments

203
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,140
to doing the data analysis so I'm

204
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,490
press the Talk I'm just going to focus
on how we did the experiments are not

205
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,750
gonna talk more about the model or the
results

206
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,370
but if you're interested I'm we have a
product page and we have a

207
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,390
journal article published in PNAS and to
you popular science articles

208
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,450
I'm if you want to read them I am I and

209
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,490
you know be more other details you can
go do that and the fights will be online

210
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,649
an so you can look at them at your
leisure

211
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,269
okay so on for signature you wanna the
simpler

212
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,070
experiments that we ran to give you a
sense have the types of things out

213
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,390
you know we're testing I'm so in this
experiment am

214
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,060
we had people look at these powers and
blocks and then again has a little dark

215
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,240
so it's hard to see

216
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,450
but an %uh so you this house the blocks

217
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,810
on and they all fall down and people
have to decide what direction they think

218
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,019
that our all fallen

219
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,810
I'm gonna do that by moving this way
line around the table

220
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,089
in order to point in the direction that
I think it's gonna fall and

221
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:13,089
art show you a short video what this
looks like

222
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
so here you see the camera spinning
around the tower

223
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,250
and the video is now playing

224
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,690
our

225
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,990
well thats unfortunate am likely

226
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:35,990
I have a damn hour after that that am

227
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:43,130
ok

228
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,320
so am okay

229
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,649
cameras and around the tower and now the
line appears and I can move it to point

230
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,310
in the direction that I think it will
fall

231
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,260
think it's gonna fall there and

232
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,240
up so this is a general idea and just
repeats from

233
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,140
from there on an and a

234
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,640
but this is it you know traditional
psychology experiment usually you

235
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,339
well just like us about to say like yes
I think it's gonna fall or no I think

236
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:13,740
it's not gonna fall or

237
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,899
you know give a rating on a scale from
one to 10 this is much more engaging

238
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,769
than that because you can actually make
a judgment in the three-dimensional

239
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:20,630
world

240
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,990
in real time %uh so it feels like you're
actually

241
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,390
you know making a judgment about a real
scene as opposed to something that's

242
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,490
you know just on your computer am so

243
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:37,490
okay how do we do that am so the

244
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,459
senator of flow out how this works is we
first

245
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,390
and create graphics model of to depict
objects that are seen so that's

246
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,120
know the blocks I actually have to
render those models and we do that using

247
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,610
rendering engine and we then cad
physical dynamics using a physics engine

248
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,649
and then we link the graphics and
physics together so that when his ex a

249
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:58,480
simulated

250
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,720
the graphics will move along with a
answer it you know it looks like a

251
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,949
realistic simulation

252
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:07,300
on so not gonna go into like the
specifics of the code here

253
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,390
I am I was gonna go over conceptual
overview the steps but

254
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,420
I have code on line for the demo that
i'm gonna be showing you

255
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,640
on in addition to the other demoss an

256
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,290
and so you can go look at that if you're
interested also can it really has a

257
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,019
really good

258
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,250
on hello world tutorial thats I'm going
to get started with your

259
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,760
interested okay so step one is to create
a graphics file

260
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,180
and you typically do this and a separate
program a separate 3d modeling program

261
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,930
my plunder

262
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,579
so have you am the problem you might
have heard a blunder marv you may have

263
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:38,040
heard a

264
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,089
a buyer for example but I plunder
because it's open source

265
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:46,910
and its python script herbal am and so
where you end up seeing here is

266
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,699
on the bottom are these are different
views have the our geometry

267
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:54,000
on the jargon term is like mash so here
is I

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,339
view from the top down these are two
different side views this is a

269
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:01,160
camera perspective you've got the
preview look like over here we have the

270
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,079
tech sure that we're gonna apply to the
match

271
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,649
and then here is the final rendered
preview and water Graphics object

272
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:10,199
actually looks like about this is a
static rendering so what we want to

273
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,610
surrender in real time

274
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,319
am so what we're going to do is pilot

275
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:18,690
into a our graphics engine rendering
engine

276
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,310
bike and a three-day and Kansas City is
written in C five spots

277
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,560
but it also has python bindings even do
everything a python with that

278
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,110
an and add to the way that panda 3d
decides what to render it has a thing

279
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,180
called a scene graph

280
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,260
and other at the scene graph is air
special

281
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,829
object called render and I this is a
hierarchy av

282
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:44,399
are objects called no pass and no path
basically points two more specialized

283
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:44,949
attacks

284
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:48,029
like models are lights or camera I am

285
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,110
and add to the way that you interfaced
attacks

286
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,399
said the rate we have render everything
under under will get rendered

287
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,480
had it's called render am and so we can
load our model

288
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,850
Sophia saved the the previous model that
I showed you for example as what block

289
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,110
to eg and Ag is just the extension that
can it really is a sports models

290
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,279
on 3 like that and we created no
passcode lock graphics to point out that

291
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,550
so we can interface with that

292
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,089
and then we add a blog graphics to the
scene graph so now if we were to run

293
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,630
panda 3d and look at it

294
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,199
we would see a block an its

295
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,579
number interesting at this point it's
just a block and all the screen am

296
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,890
but it is being rendered in real-time
which is what we want

297
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,120
so we can make it more interesting by
adding in physics up so

298
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,540
to do that re are going to use it for
the center called bullet

299
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,890
which is also written in C pas plus but
also has python bindings

300
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,589
and are more importantly it's actually
included in panda 3d

301
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,180
so I it has built-in support for
interfacing between had a 3d ample

302
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,870
objects the same way you interface

303
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,120
with any other you know peta 3d objects
like the model

304
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,459
so on the way we render physics RR

305
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,250
tonight for sex is by creating an
avocado bullet world

306
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,990
and this keeps track of all other
physical objects and it computes

307
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,470
office XO if you do i won time stop for
the physics

308
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,559
to figure out what the next position if
all the objects needs to be

309
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,880
if any of them are detected as colliding
it will figure out how they bounce off

310
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,559
each other

311
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,850
et cetera and so I the way

312
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,650
and that we represent physics attacks
are 30 components

313
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,970
the first as a shape orkut and geometry
automatically specifies

314
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,329
how the other than that computes
collisions works so on

315
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,620
depending on you know what object is
that you're trying to stimulate you

316
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,179
might want to use a sphere or

317
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,600
a box or maybe a con all these are
collision shape

318
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,350
primitives on that your money is here
and other thing is the body which

319
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,490
actually specifies

320
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,010
their dynamics themselves so this is
stuff like math Center vast fiction

321
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,860
I'm so you combine those two and you get
a full physical object

322
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,980
so we are gonna create our physics world
arm

323
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,280
and then we can create a shape here we
use a box-shaped because we're doing

324
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,130
blocks

325
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,190
I am and then we create a body reset the
shape is a child of the body

326
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,890
and then we add body to the world so now
we should be able to simulate physics

327
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,780
on and and backed hopefully this video
will work this time

328
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,200
am so this %uh it might be hard to see
in the back

329
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,000
but this block now has a rat outline
around it this is actually a special

330
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,899
d-bag heard that had a 3d has

331
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,940
well render like a skeleton are a
wireframe have the physical objects

332
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,309
which is really useful and telling where
they are or

333
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:30,929
what size they are and this blue line
sticking up is just

334
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:34,780
a the the access there's also a green
line which you probably can't see which

335
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,140
is

336
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,590
am I did axe for the y-axis am

337
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,860
so if we run this we'll see

338
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,050
is the physics after falls down

339
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,669
am but they cover objective not act like
that more time

340
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,550
that well fast

341
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,140
abs this isn't exactly what we wanted
and the we actually probably could have

342
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,990
predicted that

343
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,700
because if we take a look back at our
graphic an

344
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,030
on this two-part are not connected so
like

345
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,809
pedigree doesn't actually know that
graphics and physics should be linked

346
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,929
together so we have to explicitly tell
it

347
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:12,750
am because bullets infinitive can a 3d
wreaking created no path

348
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,500
and point it at the physics object and
then every Sat

349
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,950
the a the topic to be a parent up the
graphics

350
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,110
now this is a really powerful party the
same graph is

351
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,809
because it's a parent at the graphics on
the move it around the graphic to also

352
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:27,580
move

353
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,970
and you can do this even with you know
like empty node path

354
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,880
so do you have a whole tower blocks you
can have a new path just for the tower

355
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,620
and then you know individual notepad 32
the box if you move around

356
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,570
the big note path for the whole power it
will move around all the box as well

357
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,470
so if we set it up like this now one the
physics moves

358
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,520
because at the physical stimulation
graphic to also move

359
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,490
every take a look at what this looks
like

360
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,140
now see that the block calls for physics
and graphics which is that we're on

361
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,600
so this is a pretty simple example I am

362
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,179
you know it's not nearly as a you know
interesting as

363
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:10,260
the demo that I showed you where know
you judge the direction that it's gonna

364
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:10,850
fall

365
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,290
but is really like the basics that you
need in order to do this

366
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,940
once you are able to do this at the
physics and the graphics you can do the

367
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,429
rest

368
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,140
am fairly straightforwardly so

369
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,850
I show you two more demos am NOT
experiments are done

370
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,159
so this one is an I tried to come up
with a

371
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,950
a short cute name for and I couldn't so
blue box together to make it are stable

372
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,780
am and so that's basically the idea is

373
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,370
you can are create attachment between
blocks to hear the green block and a

374
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,300
purple block are attached because it has
a slight white glue stuff in between

375
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,240
on and you want to try to make us your
passions as possible in order to make

376
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,500
the tower stable

377
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,399
and in enough for this experiment we
actually added in the idea of having a

378
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,140
score so you get points for

379
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,500
every block it stay standing and you
lose points every block that falls down

380
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,030
he also is points for each attachment so
really motivates people to try to add

381
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,980
make issue attachment as possible and am

382
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,610
as it is really a No a much more
engaging interesting goal oriented

383
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,330
experiment in the previous one

384
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,850
I think it's a lot more fun as well am
but had a video

385
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,740
hopefully it will work we'll see

386
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,940
so that's what it looks like without and
any attachments it just falls

387
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,080
obviously and we can make some
attachments that might not necessarily

388
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,149
I'm work but you see the objects there
are

389
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:35,220
attached arm every can make attachment
that actually make the tower

390
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,580
entirely stable and so he rerun physics
and

391
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,490
doesn't bother I'm so that's the idea
behind this experiment

392
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,139
am the next experiment

393
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,340
is in my opinion the most fun I am I

394
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,879
so you the you might notice this looks
kinda like the table so sure you at the

395
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,940
beginning with the reading a box on them

396
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,389
we actually did run that experiment and
this is the next version of it

397
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:02,850
sensitive saying that the tower ordered
cable will be banned were saying

398
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,030
that you have to but the table in order
to knock out the yellow box

399
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,690
but not the red box so you get points
for every hour block tech falls off and

400
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,020
you lose points for every red light that
falls off

401
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,419
and you get to choose the direction and
magnitude of the arrow

402
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,429
to specify you know where'd about the
table how hard about the table

403
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:22,510
and said this is really fun am now

404
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,149
jokingly I a re can call angry box three
day because it's

405
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:30,550
I you know it's not exactly like Angry
Birds you know with

406
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,240
in that case you have to throw
projectile this case you are putting a

407
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,550
table but you're still trying not cover
the structure

408
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,010
I am and said it's really fun to do I
you know I

409
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,899
often 1 I'm talking about it president
saying like I'm doing it experimenter

410
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:46,050
you know whatever your terminology a
normal user I'll say like

411
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,250
I'm actually playing at am such a year
video

412
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,840
but it looks like

413
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,919
so there's a camera spinning around it
am

414
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:03,919
I yeah it's these videos now I also have
a demo this

415
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:13,100
okay so there's a camera spinning around

416
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,060
and here's the arrow exchange the size
make it smaller make it bigger

417
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,030
an turnabout here and

418
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,080
mostly a box full of which is good

419
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,020
an at do this when you can also change
the viewpoint

420
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,399
if you need a a better view

421
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:36,790
them so on and so forth I really like
this one its it's so much fun to do

422
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,570
like I feel like I could do it all day
I'm and actually so Peter

423
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,409
my colleague ran this experiment on
people at MIT

424
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:49,419
and he said that people reported to have
that they be willing to pay to do this

425
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:52,780
how where like normally we pay them
money

426
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,980
to come in and do the experiment recon
armor like psychology experiments they

427
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,600
needed an incentive to come do it

428
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,659
but they be willing to pay for that of
I'll

429
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,940
so I am third that the idea

430
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,990
and other I'll be experience I have time
to show you today

431
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,110
if you're interested in doing any of
them personally even come talk to me

432
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,669
afterwards and I have the demos on my
computer so you can run them

433
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:17,830
I'm so just to wrap up I'm

434
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,629
we have the question of how people
reason about the physical world and

435
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:25,379
our hypothesis is that you have this
physics engineer had and I sure do some

436
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:26,530
experiments

437
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,700
that we built using these tools blunder
panda 3d and bullet

438
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,110
I'm better really fun and engaging and
really are a good way of testing

439
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:39,600
on you know this hypothesis and I didn't
talk very much about the model but

440
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,690
we use the same tools to make the model
and we find that this model is a pretty

441
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,629
good account of how people reason these
situations

442
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:49,500
I'm so you know coming back to the
beginning a little bit assure you this

443
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,210
code about Angry Birds

444
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,780
am an ass to think about you know how
much science you could do if

445
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,639
if we have a temper popularity and I
think that with these tapes if

446
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:03,310
in Beijing experiments am that you know
if that doesn't seem impossible that we

447
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,409
could do something that

448
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:07,770
pretty popular like Angry Birds maybe
not quite at that scale

449
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,020
but I mean if people are willing to pay
for the last one

450
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,350
like you know for got it on the iPod or
something

451
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,580
I think we could really scale to stop
and get a lot of data

452
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,120
and that's a really exciting possibility
to me so

453
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,500
I saw to thank the people who have been
involved with this project

454
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,550
are just her mom here is my advisor ira
and I T

455
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:32,300
and is a car author on the paper that we
published about this a Tom Griffiths is

456
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,200
now my advisor at berkeley

457
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,320
the lab I was in both MIT and now
berkeley and of course all the tools

458
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,040
that made this research possible

459
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,510
Python itself and the 32 also been
talking about today panda 3d blender and

460
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,300
bullets

461
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,850
am I Python umpire after the five high
stock and despite actually were created

462
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,159
using iPad for notebook

463
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:54,639
am and two converted to revealed that
dry ass

464
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:57,960
ASO really know python has been an
integral part of this whole research

465
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
from the very beginning

466
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,210
all the way to presenting at the end
down and

467
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:09,210
again here are some links if you're
interested in learning more thanks

468
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,470
okay

469
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,139
so now we will be doing Q&A I if you
have any questions please line up at the

470
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:21,340
microphone in the center there

471
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:28,340
thank you

472
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,600
good Thanks for interesting

473
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,629
I'm just wondering abode

474
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:45,769
the what could be the possible cause for
the engagement

475
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:49,090
what makes it so I D

476
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,590
go to similar the physics engine in our

477
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,929
you how many you mean like what

478
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:59,320
I am but what's in the brain that lets
us do that know so what

479
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,669
why why is angry bird so popular why why
doesn't make it so I D

480
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:08,009
what is that I fear an a question I'm

481
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:11,960
you know

482
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,340
I I don't have like a super great answer
to that am

483
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,529
I think probably because partially
because it's

484
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:22,139
challenging am and partially because am

485
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:25,730
Mike it requires us to use machinery

486
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,700
that we don't normally have to use but
that we r like good at using when we do

487
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,249
use it

488
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:34,230
but I that's like an open research
question

489
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,149
so good question thanks to talk

490
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:43,519
arm i was just wondering about the
capabilities have bullet for example

491
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,639
like if you were to simulate damn and a
really small scale staffer

492
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:51,909
really large scale staff the physics
have been very different right

493
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:55,539
cell yeah I know how capable it is

494
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:59,320
so bullet bomb do like super large scale
stuff like

495
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,639
am you know what do like gravitational a
fax

496
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,480
beyond just rigid body gravity I

497
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,320
super small stuff like better add-on

498
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,480
I don't you mean to say I gotta love
Mike Adams stuff but

499
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,789
no can't do that am in general I am

500
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:20,869
like if you get too small or too large
it sometimes runs into instability

501
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:21,419
issues

502
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,600
answer requires a little bit wreaking to
get that working quite right

503
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,769
an but it's pretty robust for like

504
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:31,059
you know things that are the size have
you know people

505
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:34,330
about active and also can do things like

506
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:38,980
costimulation on which we haven't done
anything with yet but at has

507
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,609
other capabilities that are really
interesting to you hi

508
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:50,710
arm first on I I love the enthusiasm
with which you play with your experiment

509
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,019
them easy on a brief academic side track

510
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:57,619
I I was working with probabilistic
models

511
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:02,649
for educational about a year ago and I
stumbled across your MIT group

512
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:06,889
researchers are where causality and and
vision entrances

513
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:10,179
played a huge role do you to you work
with that

514
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:14,009
stuff in this particular physics engine

515
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:17,059
yen if so on yeah I mean you did mention
some

516
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:20,289
in the beginning so how would you
structure your

517
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:23,980
a brief I mean obviously yep I'm
repression

518
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,119
sir I so the way that the physics engine
works

519
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:31,690
and in terms of like making predictions
about stuff is thats

520
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,149
if I really busy and on you run some
probabilistic

521
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,749
samples and then you can like samples
victim you have them

522
00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:42,830
am but I've been doing some work and i'm
looking at how people

523
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,239
I actually confer physical properties
from watching

524
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:49,909
like these types of simulation so like
if some other box for heavier than

525
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:52,869
others and that cause the tower to fall
in a different way I can people make

526
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:53,450
those types

527
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,090
inferences and that requires using no
immediate model

528
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,159
thats you work in progress

529
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,279
but am yet but definitely that 30 paper

530
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,269
modeling that we're doing here three
legal and and so what actually

531
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:11,679
but me talk about ask you about this is
with every successive I mean

532
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,049
it's an obvious every success experiment
you see the more detail like believe

533
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:16,739
updation

534
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:21,470
and whether this particular one is so
using this is not a graph structure

535
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,210
inference

536
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,450
in particular but there's other
researcher and

537
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,369
so what further for stuff with by
conferring mass we can definitely do

538
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:35,029
things about point updating and in this
particular these experiments what I

539
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:35,889
should do here

540
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:39,210
wooden require about ok

541
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,460
up baby how to talk to you more about it
later yes sir thank you

542
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,480
up

543
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,809
our pressure I had more questions about

544
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:52,279
I'll and act like can it do you

545
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:58,330
cast simulation like object on ok

546
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:02,099
and I I

547
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:05,129
pre-christian I so it an

548
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,580
I can I think you can do

549
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,200
add deformable objects I'm not entirely
sure

550
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,679
we haven't done anything with that yet
an I

551
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,869
in terms of probabilistic first classic
simulations

552
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:22,450
bullet itself cannot but that's like
that essentially like what we're

553
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,339
building on top a bullet to create a
model

554
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:28,429
and then in terms of a as I was the last

555
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:33,359
a question but yes adding fourth alright
yes out

556
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,389
I so you actually you can set the
gravity to be whenever you want

557
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:40,909
it's not you know in a diaper and a by
default your to set that so you could

558
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:44,039
absolutely shattered be nine-point

559
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:47,080
and there's a really interesting
experiments that people have been doing

560
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,480
in

561
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,349
in terms like having people reason about
situations in which the gravity is like

562
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:59,179
put up side down father 5.0 but it's
really for every search

563
00:31:59,179 --> 00:31:59,429
thank you
