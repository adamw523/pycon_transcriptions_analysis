15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,219
so our final speaker love the day I like
to introduce arm

16
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,829
brought angel I am Bright Angel

17
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:22,579
you talking to us about employing pipe
on to report real time

18
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:29,579
resource bills in the to operation
managers picket topics are one now

19
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:35,640
tired enough closing would be good or
bad but a

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,780
think it's great telescope II wanna

21
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,549
have a word of caution is that I'm not a
programmer I'm actually

22
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:47,729
trained up and on architecture but I got
kinda into

23
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,599
a position where we really had to employ
pie part to do a project we're doing is

24
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,420
he said occurs

25
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,429
sour surfed for those that don't know
you see said occurs as the University

26
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:01,640
California attackers are about an hour
away from sepsis go south for

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,020
on the Central Coast is a picture
whatever dumpsters are

28
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,099
that gets a Monterey Bay View love the
ocean

29
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,250
which is really nice there on the bottom
left corner as our

30
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,090
happy have but at a slug which is the
mascot ever see

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,959
and and the rest the campuses has a lot
to read words

32
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,100
and as a you know quite beautiful our
doctors

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,299
of course material evidence showed up
this magnificent trees

34
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:30,859
here the casey et that there's this is
kinda typography graphic power

35
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,590
topography map apps are at the actual
campus in augusta two-parter felines

36
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,049
other

37
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:38,739
white-out but you could see they were
very hilly and over

38
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:43,650
it's a constant hell site for the entire
campus we running a fleet of about 10

39
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,389
trucks

40
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:48,739
I am we have that's on the left is what
you call a front loader in the middle is

41
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,190
what you call a role of box and then on
the right is a box truck we have

42
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,630
10 trucks all we have a roughly 300
dumpsters every run on campus

43
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,079
overall in house have a very robust
takeover

44
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,599
we saw paul Fisher at the bottom is our
own sort line

45
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,319
over 18 only you see schools to have one
and then on the writer some the bins we

46
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,239
have to hear a

47
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,060
to maintain and terror work on and
there's over

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,480
is roughly 300 pence are been set for
speaker that we have to run run which

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,430
takes a little labor

50
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,519
so for those that you know that don't
know and the state of california all the

51
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,159
municipalities and counties have to get
to hear what they call

52
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,530
75 percent landfill diversion by 2020
that means that

53
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,220
only 25 percent all the waste is
produced waste is produced in the state

54
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,670
can go into landfills a for the UC
schools

55
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,969
the the terrorists we have to hit to
over we have a goal to hit

56
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,010
zero waste which means less than five
percent waste by the year 2020

57
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,879
the same time frame so Dustin schools
are we're really working hard

58
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,159
this is a a graphic of how our way
stream has worked in the past

59
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,849
a well since 2000 almost ten years and
you could see it the very right hand

60
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:00,530
corner

61
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,459
the red line is refuse and then the dark
yellow line is our diverse right now 62

62
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,090
percent

63
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,310
so even though you're supposed to hit 75
percent last year I'll we r

64
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,390
far from that in our operations and we
also

65
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,099
very far from my 2020 a six-year golf
outings are West

66
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:21,419
so have to think bigger well we did when
I started two years ago

67
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,840
like a few weeks before I started I they
installed what we call the load been

68
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,560
system which

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,280
actually ways are refuse cardboard other
materials as being picked up

70
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,700
this allows us to actually I no

71
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,979
which customers have deposited what
materials where

72
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,849
and we can start doing data analysis on
our so we have been doing that else's

73
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,550
last year

74
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,599
fiscal year 2012 4:13 and we can find
our for worst

75
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:51,700
I refuse users with a pinpoint them and
say okay

76
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,750
that the big tall one else family said
housing

77
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,909
and we say to them pay you know we
haven't really talked to them yet but we

78
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:01,900
know that that's where waste problems
are and we're gonna have to really it

79
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,280
doesn't

80
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,930
the pic the big fish speak her

81
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,880
so we have a lot of pressure to increase
our process capacity

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,039
even though we're at about 70 percent
I'm we really have a difficulty

83
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,000
and achieving a high in a 95 percent
because most that stream has to come

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,849
from architects

85
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:25,070
so right now we write we have about 30
per citizen refuse about 15 percent

86
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,099
is cardboard another 15 assorted
recycled

87
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:31,620
but this other 30 percent that it's
gonna come to refuse

88
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,719
is your soil paper your food waste
mostly the stuff

89
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,039
if you look around at this conference
center you know this is not an organic

90
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:38,479
then

91
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,640
but if you go to Step Cisco a lot I'm
sure they click their soul paper and

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,419
they said click their food waste

93
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:46,800
sepsis go Vancouver are some the only
cities are actually have

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,399
taking this animal on and all the season
after all try to figure it out

95
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,260
and it's difficult nothing I wanted to
make sure to mention here is that since

96
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,580
2008 since we had a great recession

97
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,919
i'd of its all the ISI's but definitely
are you see

98
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,099
they want to hire anyone they want to
keep labor at the minimum a two-step

99
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,120
2008-2009 level

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,399
where there's I mean we barely have
enough people to drive the trucks much

101
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:10,750
less

102
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,219
at capacity what we're doing and even
like my position which was

103
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:17,529
for time with overtime sometimes I'm a
part-time

104
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:20,890
at best so well apartheid

105
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,680
so that's a big issue we get we have to
figure out how to do this whole the

106
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,250
stream

107
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,430
with less with basically the same labor

108
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,330
so I the a had no idea is gonna be
getting into this when I got this job

109
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,419
but now my cup

110
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,459
this whole system has to change in order
to to achieve what we're looking for

111
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:39,130
if you look at what they do attempt to
scare what they're doing it back over

112
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,760
what they do probably here

113
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,060
and everything is built and money is
made based on

114
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,589
largely emptying empty servicing empty
dumpsters

115
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:52,959
their load man has a that the other
program talk about has an entire

116
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,270
I a graphics metrics analysis tool that
tells you

117
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,610
if you have too much density in your
dumpsters and

118
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,760
if you have too much density than you
have a problem client that means it

119
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,430
they're putting too much wasted well
that means that they're covering their

120
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,360
labor by

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,500
dumps use it you know emptying servicing
into dumpsters

122
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,279
but for us but we have a shortage of
labour we would like to flip that

123
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,219
and have every dumpster as far as
possible when we pick it up

124
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:22,599
which is different than almost anyone
else out there

125
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,560
and so that's when that we started
thinking about well how do we do this

126
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,630
had a way if

127
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,459
wicked do just the traditional route
what we do and we were inspired

128
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:34,839
her I was inspired by a of course the
Internet of Things

129
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,269
type movement I guess you could call it
and we also had a demonstration by

130
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:42,950
big belly which is the top struggle
after the a side the canister

131
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,279
on the left so the big belly they will
come to your community

132
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,330
they've done Boston Boston University I
think enough to have any overseas

133
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,360
on the west coast certain Canada but
they'll come to you and I'll say okay we

134
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,339
can basically cut out ninety percent
appear

135
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:02,440
waste pickup from this from these bids
using this on-demand

136
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,110
their own autumn and technology and when
we talk to write but he had this for

137
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,849
dumpsters cuz we don't really have a

138
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:11,839
an issue with that we have a issue with
dumpsters and the right now the site

139
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,810
we don't have that for copiers so we
decided to do it ourselves

140
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,510
and what we did is we we stock to
different

141
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,130
a companies into things kinda companies

142
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,500
and we came to digi was the one that was
very

143
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,419
cooperative with us and they had
somebody that they put their

144
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,930
but there are actual communication
devices and and

145
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,860
this is that Massa a sonar in three
Sardar and they said this would be great

146
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
for your test

147
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,250
pilot and it runs on ARM

148
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,100
you know the communicator died devices
and you can get one tomorrow

149
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,640
mean expensive but where like okay let's
try it out

150
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,829
and this one the so what we did is we
actually installed

151
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:58,060
a well first I had installed on my home
my my my office

152
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,040
trash can see if it worked headed for
the record on a dumpster that about 15

153
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,649
feet from my office

154
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:08,170
and that's what looks like but when I
installed it all we really had as the

155
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,110
data was being

156
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,529
deliver to DiGi's proprietary

157
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:15,579
in a cloud location and they could do
some

158
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:19,300
graphics for something like that but it
was pretty intense for an operator are

159
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,970
sorry that's managing our crew

160
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,660
20 I have to go to this and try to
figure out how to decipher

161
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,620
it wasn't gonna work we needed something
much more pedestrian to speaker

162
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,990
user-level

163
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,430
so a as talking about this so here was
the concept that

164
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,720
I had originally thought I haven't
thought I could handle on my own

165
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,459
to actually deliver this in I had no
idea what I thought was a time so we

166
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:41,480
would have the dumpster

167
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,300
that sexual dumpster with the the thing
at the Surana

168
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,790
anywhere talk to you pass some sort
interface I thought the cloud could do

169
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,550
it but it didn't

170
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,410
and then it would put it on that website
so I'm Meyer heavy equipment manager can

171
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,530
look at it

172
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,780
well they didn't work out what we ended
up doing is that we had a

173
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,820
intern come in I'll not intersted worker
and you taken a single class and by fun

174
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,430
that a semester before

175
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,750
in our stock game he was our data entry
for a while for us because our

176
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,670
is gonna have a hard time with the
recycle Kors so they can after I'm on me

177
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,270
and active call kinda like developer
tight kid and so

178
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,440
he came in NE Ohio I love to help you up
so this is the kinda systematic we came

179
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,430
up with

180
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,870
and a we have the met the sonar talks to
a gateway and everybody's is this a

181
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,310
wireless router shit this wireless
systems but

182
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,760
them the sonar talk sergei where the
Gateway put a cloud and then from the

183
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,730
cloud way

184
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,240
I'm I co-worker don't actually wrote a
Python script that word

185
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,900
retrieve the information from the cloud
and then it would deposit into spots

186
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,310
around prefer a text file

187
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,250
for me and then an Excel spreadsheet so
we would have a record of every

188
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,610
every soldier reading and what I did a

189
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,880
you know I am a group I went to college
in the 90s so I knew nothing HTML to get

190
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,620
us by on creating a website I would
actually show whatever's on this text

191
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,320
file that's being updated with each star
rating

192
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,930
so it's kinda the way it worked out so
that we end up with we have a website

193
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,080
that I run to left and we ended up with
two files

194
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,150
in we're able to use the website to
check it every hour whatever it was

195
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,070
updated

196
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,490
in the naked run out to the dumpster see
if it actually working or not

197
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,020
network for the most part and we're
getting great data from it

198
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,230
so this is how the data kinda looks at
after using this for

199
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,700
what is that two months ago if yep so

200
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,020
we already had our load man data which
is the gray line and it's telling us how

201
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,450
much weight is being polled

202
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,620
are picked up every pick up from the
dumpster so we have the virus is 66 in

203
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,960
218

204
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,400
and then the Green Line is the actual a
volume how much

205
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,529
the sonar was actually reading how much
of it was for also

206
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:50,020
went from you know 5 percent to your

207
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,510
seventy-four percent 34 percent is the
highest number what I thought was

208
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,620
interesting there was great about this
is that we actually start picking up

209
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,080
a mistakes so the red dots across the
square

210
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,200
dots across the middle those are driver
locks

211
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,660
so the driver will actually go and in an
Excel spreadsheet will mark which

212
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,800
dancers they feared

213
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,070
and then I know from this top sir which
is labeled

214
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,180
by specifically that that's when they
pick them up those are the days

215
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,180
succ could see on a number day are

216
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,440
I'm sorry incident a have marked that
the

217
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,370
a driver noted that they actually picked
up the dumpster

218
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,420
which means that we actually would bill
that dumpster you know cuz we have a

219
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,910
recharge system for

220
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,940
for clients but if you look at the sonar

221
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,220
and if you look at load man nothing was
picked up

222
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,080
so that obviously mistakenly picked up
with a digital with the two systems

223
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,090
but if you look at the a you'll notice
that

224
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,090
the sonar dots out see how in the lines
go away the bar let me set the

225
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,570
volume is empty a.m. the sonar don't
doubt

226
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,040
and then the driver noted that they
actually picked up but load man didn't

227
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,690
pick it up

228
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:00,450
so you can tell us are double-checking
who what's working what's not working

229
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,570
on the far right it also gave a secret
service

230
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,610
a straight line which was never good

231
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,750
and that was only had a battery battery
failure for 6

232
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,020
almost a week I'm and we didn't realize
until

233
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,960
we can I like when he was working with
adequate looking at it when I just come

234
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,620
back and see if it s still working

235
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,830
and I was wife and I we had a better her

236
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,040
so this kinda has huge implications on
an entire

237
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,450
the whole system love waste hauling her
resource recovery

238
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,589
so we can I can probably go through the
deferred if

239
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:36,490
for people are from so there's the the
traditional system is what you call a

240
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,080
biometric service-oriented work %uh

241
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,330
research recovery that's when I your

242
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,060
like pro everybody's you steer you have
a bit and it's a particular size that's

243
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,470
one

244
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,080
1-yard are it's a if your household you
know the size

245
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,520
they charge you so many dollars per
month butter a picture just 55 bucks

246
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,180
to serve in a row service it on a weekly
basis so that a biometric system

247
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,440
that's the dominant system throughout
the at least North America

248
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,779
and is to go to zero waste with that
system can be very troublesome

249
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,550
I'm except Cisco any space are working
on it was recalling G

250
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,760
but and what they've done is by they'll
pick up the charger for the refugees

251
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,830
picked up

252
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,430
and then they'll of couple Metairie
kinda like

253
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,830
at and a researcher at the recycling any
other streams

254
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,270
in addition but they base all their
money on the refuse

255
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,000
but what happens is you keep having to
increase you refuse charge

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,050
and you have to make the the buying
smaller as you get closer to zero waste

257
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,600
so it's like a self

258
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,640
I it's it doesn't its economy a logical
system to continue to follow

259
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,980
what other cities like Vancouver have
done is a at least the city of

260
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,950
Vancouver's on buildings they have set
up a contract with

261
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,760
there holler waste management based on
performance

262
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,330
they say okay for the last ten years we
had this much volume

263
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,570
and you charge just as much money and
we're going to pay you for the next 10

264
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,490
years based on that allocation of cash
how much cost us

265
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,760
and you will serve assessed 20 way said
they will come to the table getting

266
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,279
what's the contractor that still
difficult because

267
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,370
I has it that a very difficult to

268
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,200
thing to go by is to say well
historically we had this much by am

269
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,260
and we want to keep making money based
on that I am but does that really

270
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,040
in directly induce you to go to zero
waste how does that work in a scepter

271
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,270
be with a community that really wants to
do it they're not gonna do it because I

272
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,140
financial

273
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,230
reasons so we're proposing that we don't
know if anybody else is doing this but

274
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,440
for proposing a weight-based resource
recovery system where

275
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,410
if you we're gonna charge by the pound
right now we think it's really about 22

276
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,690
cents a pound

277
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,420
for refuse pick up it will charge less
for our recycling pickup

278
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,839
and we'll be able to monitor that with
our login system

279
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,960
will say okay you know you paint we
picked up 700 pounds yesterday from your

280
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,670
so the seven hundred times twenty cents
US for the next bill

281
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,870
and then but the only way that really
works

282
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,100
for us operationally because you know

283
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,870
a ideally everyone will discontinue
using refuse the hill

284
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,000
go down to five percent no need us less
I don't need is in a different way

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,330
intro what that works for us as we have
to find a

286
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,570
efficiencies our operations to make it
so that we still can

287
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,740
keeper budget that is cash positive
suspect

288
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,290
so in order to do that that's what a
smart dumpster comes in we were only

289
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,680
pick it up it's for

290
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,000
or after a two-week time period and then
we can

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,899
use our guys for other media day
organics line that we need ur

292
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,430
introduce our cardboard all the other I
diversion activities that are necessary

293
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,730
that we don't really have time to do
right now because we're spending so much

294
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,459
time picking up

295
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,959
empty dumpsters so

296
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,540
some are smart dumpster was successful
we loved it

297
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,230
it would work we were able to say okay
the

298
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,140
the the script worked we had a record a
powerful it got

299
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,300
how often we could how much we could
reduce our pick ups based on the actual

300
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,320
weight there was an

301
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,199
or the actual volume when it was for and
as so we found a company to sepsis

302
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:05,959
counter

303
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,350
capacitor Cisco found us and asked us if
we would like to be one of the first

304
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,299
clients

305
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,699
and their Harbor company at an incubator
answer Cisco that are actually building

306
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,939
were kinda like building is proposing
building one

307
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,760
on their own and they're called Cup
ology and their system isn't

308
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,880
you know it's there prior system so I am

309
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,949
care I talk about it much more other
than they've kinda realized the

310
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:31,529
dashboard that we had been talking about
for almost a year and a half

311
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:35,110
and this is what it looks like in our
actual guys we have a third over

312
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,460
refuse a dumpsters are rigged for
fiercer

313
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,049
with these with their sensors and we use
them now

314
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:46,409
every day to see which ones to pick up
up the forty-three when therefore

315
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:49,919
before we thought 75 percent would be
good and now realizing that if it's

316
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,460
about 60-65 percent by Terry pick it up

317
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,130
it's falling ready to be a ready be held
but what's

318
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,330
this our relationship with Compal a GR
comfort quest

319
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,320
doing a with going on with such a huge
contract with these guys that were

320
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,809
very new to the business some anime no
fair I understand a hauling works

321
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:12,669
I mean I don't understand three years
ago but we were on board with all this

322
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:15,279
because that little python script that
was written

323
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,179
that gave us the daily reading up what's
going on and

324
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,389
to be able to bring the real world a

325
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:25,580
values to your desk you know and to you
our

326
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,429
our own not system so their summer
different concerns and drawbacks with

327
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:33,179
the implementation first I had wrought
we

328
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,340
had RT RT sure the battery life and now
is we're going to release after the

329
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,850
campus maybe next year have all of
campus

330
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,549
up so worried about peer errors because
the battery life

331
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:46,619
I know that's not a big deal with Python
but that's the these are like the

332
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:47,440
reality

333
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,330
for bridging the suffer side with the
actual harbor in the field

334
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,669
second is that I am we've always been
worried about communications out of

335
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:56,399
anybody

336
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:59,559
has heard about the controversy with the
smart meters RP jimmy's

337
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,409
I'm energy year me here electricity
boxer

338
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:08,590
electricity meter what occurs everyone
is extremely worried that they're

339
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,789
causing cancer

340
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:13,779
so a lotta times a whenever you're
proposing

341
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,389
these new technologies especially with
communications

342
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,200
if it uses a cell service IRS cellular

343
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,340
service then we start getting people
that are upset and

344
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,909
well show up and do things that are you
know

345
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:33,799
difficult operator on so I the thing
that we loved about the Digi is a radio

346
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,239
frequency which is not on the radar as
being

347
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:40,149
a bad thing and the resync apology

348
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:43,269
a meter sensors right now RSL system

349
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:47,340
and we're hoping that other WiFi dosing
that wish I was a big deal so that's

350
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,700
something to think about it

351
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,659
you actually try to poser look work on
mister Probert project

352
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,889
the third thing is that as we start
doing more zero waste

353
00:19:55,889 --> 00:20:00,570
I'm a actions like these are new
canisters that were gonna prod deploy

354
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,860
next year

355
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,389
throughout the next four years is that
the when you start bring the technology

356
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:07,820
and we had the same even the one sensor

357
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,139
I'll when I had it on the dumpster
caused by office

358
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:14,100
everyone sir talk about all operators
the building up for it at the building

359
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,980
managers

360
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,850
now that we have 143 people are actually
afraid

361
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,190
the sensors which is I mean cuz the
technology is just like this

362
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,480
weird thing they they were it's like a
big brother type thing

363
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,259
and so one thing is that they we were
worried about vandalism

364
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:32,570
because the sensors are out there I mean
we know there

365
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,070
not destructible by the way story to
people with just actually having bats

366
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,440
and doing things like that

367
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,879
but the second thing that was actually a
positive about it was that people felt

368
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,529
like they were being watched

369
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:45,570
so they actually diverted a lot better
it's almost like a camera that doesn't

370
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,029
work

371
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:49,649
on the wall well there this whole thing
was like you're being watched

372
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:53,659
people were actually pulling diverse
materials out the dumpster after they

373
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:54,559
solve a camera

374
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,429
they were thrown in there to the care in
a report out so it's been a really wild

375
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,720
on a how much difference this is making

376
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,710
but on a slight I wanted to make sure
and make a note that I am

377
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:10,779
the benefit a actually using from moving
forward with this type of

378
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:15,070
activity could have extremely positive
economic outcomes so

379
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:20,289
wanna see what exact number was sided
the numbers and if we actually

380
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:25,950
actually apply at this a smart dumpster
to the entire campus all

381
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,769
turned 50 dumpsters we have on campus
there is

382
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,970
and then we actually do the savings I
expect based on the low demand data and

383
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,619
based on our single smart

384
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:38,619
smart up sir we expected like reduce

385
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:41,799
a at least two possibly what we're gonna

386
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,019
produce growing up to do one out of
every three

387
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:48,840
pickups or services we've had to do in
the past and that equates to you

388
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,929
253 thousand dollars worth of labor that
way

389
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:55,809
death labor alone aside gas satires the
star stuff

390
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:59,749
so doing this type from this type of
activity

391
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:03,299
actually could have extremely positive

392
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:07,059
economic benefits to people like me
operators and for us

393
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,149
it's not that we want to get a fish into
lay people off which

394
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,429
I heard happens at other places for us
we just the more

395
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:16,999
labor capacity to do the other streams
you know so

396
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:21,489
that's why I think everybody's on board
so far and then XO we've been successful

397
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:22,649
with the smart up sir

398
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:26,710
and and with this whole idea but at the
all the UC's we all have our

399
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,999
sustainability plans

400
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:31,519
and everyone on my side is like

401
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,730
how the heck here do we start really
changing behavior

402
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,489
and that's what the great thing about
the sport after was is it had immediate

403
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,590
changes to pave your

404
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,659
with the drivers for one and also people
knew that they were doing

405
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,850
something they were being watched to
make sure that they do the right thing

406
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,320
well we have these are all the different
topics every have to cover and

407
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,619
sustainability plan by 2020 we have

408
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:55,769
RF anybody is from a with california's a
drought when we were turning spigots of

409
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:56,239
right now

410
00:22:56,239 --> 00:23:01,119
on campus I'm and they don't they have
to make estimates they don't have exact

411
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,080
meter numbers custer it takes time to
gather all the numbers and I'm

412
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,649
so if we were able waters the 1i think
would be the next

413
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:12,200
loafer to actually put the sensors on
and energy

414
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,639
should be something we should be able to
quickly because you already have kinda

415
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:17,259
smart meter devices almost

416
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:20,749
sup there's this the meters are out
there and then there's

417
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:24,480
a sitting operators at the desk but it's
very difficult that bridge

418
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,389
that it's critical that Piper
programmers could provide

419
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:31,549
is as a def away something that I'm
trying to your

420
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:35,679
that's why i wanna talk today say hey in
are we really need help from an operator

421
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,549
side to make this happen so that we can
actually give

422
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:41,619
dashboard readings on all the different

423
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,659
categories that we have to me and then
even

424
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:47,960
in a in a past life actually did
California recall the Act

425
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,249
activities and you had your medication
issues you have to constantly monitor

426
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:52,359
things

427
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:57,019
if you're you're disturbing them so to
speak and this is a total no other area

428
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,369
that I V

429
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:03,700
the pie phone type of bring the hardware
to this offer and bringing it together

430
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,269
cocktail you know in in good competition
could really be helpful

431
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:11,049
and I feel like anyone is really
addressing it I felt like when we did

432
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,210
the smart up sir we had a hard time

433
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,720
and getting really any help I expected I
guess maybe I didn't breach as well but

434
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,950
I'm working on it so I think that was

435
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:26,149
the main thing I just want to say is
that a I feel like it's really important

436
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:27,489
that professionals like me

437
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:30,690
we need your partnership and moving
forward and and this is the whole growth

438
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,249
area that's beyond just the strike
software

439
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:36,509
type data and management we actually

440
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:40,239
and here we have things that we could
work on time i'm looking for to your

441
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:43,379
professional career with you okay

442
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:46,600
I want to make sure think my pass rusher
and burqas he was one there

443
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,820
story pro all the stuff and I must say a
worker

444
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,419
don't and I'm ready for questions are
answers

445
00:24:53,419 --> 00:25:00,419
comments thank you

446
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:09,460
you have any questions jiska approach to
make

447
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,860
and area

448
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,040
I have more cell there

449
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,590
and coming up on me and temp

450
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,910
yard am I'll hockey and it specifically
for projects just like that

451
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,400
bring it there and here at Cody's

452
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,840
