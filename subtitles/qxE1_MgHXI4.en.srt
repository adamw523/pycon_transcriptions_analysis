00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,360
pleasure to introduce Kate Hudson and
nichols a comment

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,779
who are going to talk to you about
technical on morning

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:10,960
training and mentoring please a big big
round of applause

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,960
hey everybody

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,300
welcome to our talk sa house icon then
for everyone

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,779
Kenya play roller coaster

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:33,200
um so wanna talk to you today about
technical ongoing training and mentoring

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,430
and my name's Kate Middleton I'm a
software engineer I

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,460
and live in San Francisco California I'm
because Akerman

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,680
I'm that picture that's not her I'm
sufferance their

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,660
at membrane I'm also a graduate from
high grade academy

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,660
and I was there first senior engineer
love that ok

13
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,989
to join in and bright and I've been
helping on helping increasingly with I'm

14
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:55,370
already

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,820
each successive new junior engineer Jain
yes so the reason that a call and I

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,449
submitted the stock in the first place

17
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,979
is on we both had very separate
experience as a different companies

18
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,270
where we join the company we worked
there for a while

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,729
we reached a certain proficiency at
programming and we look back

20
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,049
on our time unlike we could have gotten
here much faster if there had been

21
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,650
any sort of onboarding at all and so we
turned around and create a program to

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,509
respective companies to help new

23
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:24,729
engineers get up to speed I'm in so we
came together and submit the stock

24
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:28,729
so what is

25
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:32,360
onboarding for the purposes of this talk
onboarding is

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,240
the process up taking someone from
outside a team and bringing them in

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,350
making them a happy productive an
independent member of the team

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,490
so today we're specifically going to be
talking about onboarding junior

29
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,170
engineers

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,890
am but a lot of the things that we do
mention today

31
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,840
are useful for people of all different
skill levels alright

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,979
why do you care I'm gonna give you four
major reasons why you should care about

33
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:56,710
on morning

34
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,020
I assume that everyone here probably
does already care since you came to the

35
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,640
stock

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,460
but I want to convince you that all
morning is important not just in general

37
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,439
but important

38
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,090
now so the four things I'm gonna talk
about %uh the productivity of the

39
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,050
individual

40
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,390
the park tivity of the company the
productivity of the team

41
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,819
and bonus diversity in at

42
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,800
the productivity of the individual so
this is a category that most people

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,120
think about building the skills at the
new engineer getting up to speed on your

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,790
tools

45
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,239
there's another category in this which
is their confidence and happiness

46
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,019
a lot of people think that confidence
follow skills when in fact

47
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,580
skills often follow confidence competent
people are outgoing

48
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,250
excited to learn new things they reach
outside the bounds so

49
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,590
ongoing is really great for increasing
both the confidence and skill set

50
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,760
have new engineers the productivity of
the company

51
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,319
companies care about money as they
should and so on morning is great for

52
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:50,640
her

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,769
for the bottom line more productive
engineers make you more money

54
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,400
and that's great and everyone's happy
because the company is making more money

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,170
the party of the team

56
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,860
this is really important because as you
add new engineers to a team

57
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,090
the team fundamentally changes with each
new person there's

58
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,090
a lot of things about how you don't
really know something unless you teach

59
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,379
it

60
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:15,700
and this is absolutely true for company
culture in process

61
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,989
if you can't explain your company
culture to a new engineer

62
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,090
and you can't explain your process for
shipping code

63
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,019
then you don't know it yourself and so
every time you add a new engineer

64
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,019
you should reiterate this post the new
person and also to the existing team

65
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,930
so you have something a little bit more
like this and as a team grows

66
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,220
this becomes increasingly important for
example at LinkedIn

67
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,650
at a certain point every new engineer
they added was decreasing

68
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,569
their productivity so the new ISP p.m.
engineering had to come in and revamped

69
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:45,239
everything

70
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,530
so that adding new engineers didn't
decrease the over overall productivity

71
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,700
other team

72
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,989
so this is one of my favorite questions
that I have ever made up

73
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,040
am I use to coach high school JV water
polo when I was in college

74
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,450
and at like 14 and 15-year-old girls are
beginners at water polo

75
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,980
and have these really philosophical team
meetings no I come in like posters and

76
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,150
so I come in with this one day just
trying to explain to them the importance

77
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,689
of teamwork

78
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:17,220
and I told them your guys ability to win
as a team

79
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,290
is the sum up your skills and talents
multiplied

80
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,180
by your ability to work together as a
team and this means that you all can be

81
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,169
less skilled

82
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,780
or more mediocre water player water polo
players who work together incredibly

83
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,530
well

84
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,889
and you can be teams are people who are
theoretically more skilled

85
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,500
or more talented but don't work together
as well and you can see this

86
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,250
in engineering teams this is absolutely
true no matter what the type of team is

87
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,460
am there's a lotta really big products
out there like

88
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,550
gmail was is one of them that were built
by teams have less than 10 people

89
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,660
some even bought by teams at less than
five people so a small team can be

90
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,850
highly productive

91
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,940
especially if they work together really
well

92
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,009
are a bonus category diversity how many
have you have read the doctor Seuss book

93
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,020
at see about the speeches anyone

94
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,650
okay spin again so it some to children's

95
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,699
poem about kind of this society where
some

96
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,120
some speeches have stars on their
bellies and others teachers don't

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,470
it's about the division that happens
within the speeches because I'll

98
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,630
the stars on some belizean and the nonce
as another cell

99
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,240
I use nature's to represent diverse city
diversity can mean many different things

100
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,960
so this happens a lot in tech what you
have is a homogeneous group

101
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,110
and they bring into the fold other
people who are like themselves and they

102
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,669
have no onboarding

103
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,789
and this works because the new person as
a lot like the people who

104
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,060
are already on the team they probably
communicate in similar ways

105
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,130
and they probably have similar hobbies
and interests so getting up to speed on

106
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,449
all the social practices within the
company

107
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,000
is easier for this person they need us
onboarding and it gives them an

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,650
advantage that they're like the existing
group

109
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,240
however if you would like to hire people
who are different

110
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,259
than the the team you already have you
don't want something like this to happen

111
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,020
you don't want people to feel

112
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,539
like they are outside the group and so
having explicit onboarding can help with

113
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:07,789
this

114
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,060
enormously a having a way to bring
people up to speed both on social

115
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,050
practices and team culture

116
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,720
in a way that doesn't rely on the
existing social structure is good for

117
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,520
diversity

118
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,440
and if you are not sold on hiring people
who are different from the team you

119
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,410
already have

120
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:29,220
feel free to come talk to me afterwards
him

121
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,600
alright cool shit on board at this is
either a picture up a bunch of and

122
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,840
scaring some food

123
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,680
or buncha people carrying a boat to open
to interpretation but

124
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,410
the idea is you should spread out the
load you don't wanna burn out on

125
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,740
boarding mentors

126
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,930
am actually a lot of people on the team
can mentor

127
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,039
and on poor people in different areas it
doesn't always have to be someone who is

128
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,620
incredibly senior

129
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,720
yeah at event bright I was paired up
with someone who was

130
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,990
really skilled and talented when I was
trying to set up my dev environment

131
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,030
initially

132
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,500
and for all his skills and talents he
hadn't recently set his environment up

133
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,430
so he didn't know you know the recent
wearables are not a bug that were in the

134
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,280
system

135
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,069
that say the most recent person to set
up their system did

136
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:15,240
so in the end I found someone who had
done it more recently

137
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,880
and he was a great help to me in setting
up my environment

138
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,430
so this is another great way to get more
people involved

139
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,639
just right away in someone's integration
into a team

140
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,470
alright how should we think about
onboarding at a conceptual level you

141
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,389
want to maximize the return on
investment

142
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,449
I think this makes sense to everyone no
one wants to put in more than they get

143
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:36,610
out of something

144
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,430
this is a really common inefficient wait
on board but I see a lot where

145
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,069
new ongoing mentors are like I'm going
to be the best

146
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:46,860
onboarding mentor ever and we're gonna
do everything together and we're gonna

147
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,099
take all these coding classes and by the
end of three months this person is going

148
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:50,590
snow

149
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,860
everything that I now and that's wildly
unrealistic and also leads to a lot of

150
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,590
burnout

151
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,160
and then companies are like we can
support emerging engineers it's just too

152
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,069
much work for everyone

153
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,789
so instead of doing something like this
I think bumper bowling is a better

154
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:05,590
analogy

155
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,419
which is it's also the only way that I
should ever Bowl set up a world

156
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,120
where the junior engineer can play
freely and make mistakes and you don't

157
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,530
have to hand hold them to the process of
getting up to speed on things are

158
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,979
learning new technologies

159
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,050
you can really kinda believe them check
in periodically and make sure that

160
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,470
they're roughly on the right track

161
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:29,090
track I am but they have the freedom to
explore and grow without burning out

162
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,240
ongoing mentors event bread I feel much
more

163
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,360
comfortable writing code and breaking
things with impunity when I know it's a

164
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,570
well-tested area

165
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,430
the code base so that I know that I'm
not gonna push anything that's gonna

166
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,140
break anything

167
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,169
production and give me a panic attack
yeah

168
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,660
so from a technical perspective having a
lot of automation are under development

169
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,140
environments and deploy

170
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,140
is really useful for hiring junior
engineers you can create

171
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,589
places where they can go and play and
not have to worry about it

172
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,690
it's also important to note that one of
the tenants have expertise

173
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,680
is the ability to set boundaries in
scope in order to scope you have to

174
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,100
understand the domain space incredibly
well

175
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,830
and so junior engineers by definition
are not good at scoping

176
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,170
and are not good at setting boundaries
because how could they be and so one

177
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,510
other things to think about is setting
these boundaries for junior engineers

178
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,550
making sure that they have this world
are they understand where they are and

179
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,630
what they're doing

180
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,670
so there are three major categories to
think about anything about how on board

181
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,839
a junior engineer

182
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,779
the first as technical knowledge
normally people focus most of their

183
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:31,380
attention

184
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,070
on technical knowledge like ninety
percent of it I think it's only roughly

185
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,560
a third of what you need to get someone
up to speed on

186
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,089
another third as the company knowledge
in process how do you ship code how do

187
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,899
you decide which features get built

188
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,680
I'm who is in charge of things and the
third the third category as personal

189
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,529
development

190
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,930
so like I said that confidence and that
a project we were someone feels like

191
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,990
they are independent

192
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,080
progressing is hugely important not to
mention the fact that if someone feels

193
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,890
like they're going somewhere in a
company they're more likely to stick

194
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,420
around

195
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,089
cell now you've hired a new junior
engineer

196
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,050
how you get this started really I'm
boarding should probably start from the

197
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,880
moment they accept your offer

198
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,690
but for our purposes were gonna define a
on morning

199
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,100
as the process of getting someone up to
speed until they can be

200
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,870
reliably independent you can they can
ask questions but you can set them up

201
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,300
for the project and know that they'll be
able to get it done without just

202
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,459
floundering around

203
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,060
so it there's really a critical first
week and probably the take at least

204
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,640
three months for any engineer to get up
to speed we're positing that probably

205
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,320
six months or years a better estimate
for junior people

206
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,399
so we call this week one it's really
arbitrary chunk of time number one

207
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,380
this is the things he should get started
as soon as possible

208
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,990
like a Devin by admin as I mentioned
buddy them up with

209
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,120
the most recent person who set up their
system

210
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,320
this is an opportunity to get multiple
people invested in their trajectory

211
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,620
introduce mentors and make those mentors
people who can be non-judgmental

212
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,800
as well as a technical resource

213
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,290
you also want to show them where you
keep technical resources

214
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,070
let's say a book that you consider at
your company to be the definitive way

215
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,250
that you do Django your company

216
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,480
point them to where they can find that
resource and they don't have ted flatter

217
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,120
and invited themselves

218
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,540
or not one thing that's really handy

219
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,540
is if they Journal our blog in keep
three things per day or per week

220
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,920
that they've learned or three things
that they didn't understand

221
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,339
they can do this for themselves but it's
also useful for them to be able to touch

222
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:38,140
base

223
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,140
with their manager a mentor regularly
and discuss these things

224
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,339
one thing that I do at a membrane and I
still have it right now

225
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,079
is document called things I've learned
and this is literally a Google Doc

226
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,060
that's fifty pages long at this point

227
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,790
and contain things like commands I
seldom need to run

228
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,100
but don't want to have to look up every
time in our documentation

229
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,570
like for example how do I update our

230
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,130
we run sconce we make sure that our RCS

231
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,029
everything is up to date and 22b inside
my room

232
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:16,850
outside so this is a place for me to
keep information like that

233
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,420
and also just things that I've learned
that I want to make sure I return

234
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:26,089
retain but I know I won't remember all
the information the first time I hear it

235
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:29,240
it be great if you can get on the ship
code in their first week but make sure

236
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,370
this is a

237
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,860
very small piece that's not very
technically complex

238
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,110
this is really just an opportunity for
them to learn your process around

239
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,980
shipping code

240
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,170
and not so much about the technical
challenges are being an engineer

241
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,000
I think this is Kate favorite slide have
a social event if you can so that they

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,180
feel like they're part of the team

243
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,450
the more likely the more they feel like
they're

244
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,579
and socially integrated with them the
more likely they are to ask questions

245
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:02,339
and you definitely want your junior
engineer to be able to ask questions

246
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,010
so this brings us to arbitrator time
number two

247
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,510
we suggest that you introduce them to
the

248
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,889
history of the company and any coding
philosophies at this point rather than

249
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:18,139
let's say day one when their brains are
already overloaded and they

250
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,639
can't possibly remember it this is still
useful information for them to have

251
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,360
their

252
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,930
so give it to them in are to return to
have time period to

253
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,230
one thing that I really wish I had when
I started at a van Praet was

254
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,660
a team at someone either hold a piece a
paper

255
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,230
or a document available online to say
this is

256
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,010
Alice she's great with automation this
is Bob

257
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,570
he's great at things that begin with be
so you should ask him questions about

258
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,010
that

259
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,070
and make sure this is a permanent
resource that they can find I know that

260
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,560
people move around asks and everything
but

261
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,350
even if they just have Alice automation
Bob

262
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,320
be related things let's really handy
especially when it comes time to ask

263
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,060
questions

264
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,800
probably my favorite part my own body
experience and a membrane was the

265
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,750
introduction of coat lads

266
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,790
this is an opportunity maybe two or
three times a week for an hour

267
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,720
for junior engineer or however many
junior engineers you have

268
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,959
to sit in a room with a senior person
and

269
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,790
ask in a totally safe space whatever
questions they can think I have no

270
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,050
matter how stupid

271
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,079
and it really does need to be a safe
place to ask those questions

272
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:30,310
otherwise they're likely to just button
up and not bother

273
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,630
when you do this though make sure that
the senior engineer is the kind who can

274
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,399
do so without judgment and is good at
explaining things

275
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,649
that's are really important facet up
this

276
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:47,600
questions that your engineers likely to
ask in this can be things like

277
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,130
what is rabbit how it is the Django or
am work

278
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,260
what is salary or even something like I
have this bug in my code and i cant

279
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,000
figure out what's going on key walked
through it with me

280
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,089
it's important to ascertain where their
knowledge begins and ends

281
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,290
so in this feel free to ask them
followup questions

282
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,750
to make sure that you're starting at a
place that's useful for them

283
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,300
and this is another opportunity to get
more people invested

284
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,550
engineer engineers development because
it doesn't have to be the same

285
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,560
engineer who's in the room with them
every time you can have someone friends

286
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,820
on Mondays for

287
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,320
questions about JavaScript you can have
someone on Wednesdays whose full stack

288
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,100
you can follow the Jenga request cycle

289
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,320
throughout and maybe Friday is a guest
star

290
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,269
every week or something like that so
this is an opportunity to spread the

291
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,720
love

292
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,070
and get your team invested another thing
that's a great tool

293
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,329
is shadowing either an hour a day or
maybe a couple hours a week

294
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:50,130
for a junior engineer to sit with the
senior engineer and listen to their

295
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,430
thought process

296
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,389
so the senior engineer will say okay so
now I'm importing this thing cuz we're

297
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,550
gonna need here

298
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,790
and then I was thinking about
structuring it this way and this is an

299
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,320
opportunity for the junior engineer to
sort of get a sense for

300
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,350
thought processes and the way that you
develop code and your code style

301
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,360
rather than getting serve bogged down in
the details about where that semicolon

302
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,940
goes

303
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,970
this brings us to arbitrator time number
three

304
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,970
we suggest that you introduce one on
ones at least by now

305
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,829
if you haven't already and this is a
once a week probably 30 minutes at a

306
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:26,560
time

307
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,720
where you can set aside to talk an
manager to engineer about

308
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,300
roadblocks or check in about anything
that

309
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,860
the engineer has on their minds and

310
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,810
one thing that we've introduced for
later engineers have started after me

311
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,600
is the idea love I'm five-minute
presentations so

312
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,660
a senior person or a manager approaches
the junior engineer

313
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,920
and says here you should check out Bloom
filters

314
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,920
let you go research that and come back
to me

315
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,279
in a week and tell me what you learned
as you guys

316
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,829
have probably figured out by now it
probably it doesn't really hurt to have

317
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:05,939
experience in doing presenting

318
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,500
early and often it's a really good skill
to develop

319
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,650
and probably one we should all start
sooner and

320
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,429
and if their manager supplies that topic
of conversation like

321
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:20,650
decorators our generators that they know
that is gonna be really useful for the

322
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,510
junior engineer

323
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:25,360
this helps them also home their research
skills which as we all know

324
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,640
is also really important and

325
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,730
murderer as Kate mentioned we learn
through

326
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,539
teaching so this will help them keep
things in their brains

327
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,590
so goal-setting is also a really
important

328
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,690
this is energy engineer and their
manager probably

329
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,910
sitting down and talking about where
each of them expect the junior engineer

330
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,460
to be an

331
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,910
a month or three months or six months so
if I say that I'm really interested

332
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,110
and pursuing data and my

333
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,130
manager was expecting that I would turn
into

334
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,410
a friend and engineer there's probably a
mismatch there

335
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,700
we need to figure out how to make both
of us happy and

336
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,640
this is a great opportunity for someone
is more senior tech help set up some

337
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,960
intermediate steps

338
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,110
to get them there

339
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,450
for example short term goal can be you
should be able to find and fix a bug

340
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,750
based on a century ever

341
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,760
or comment meaningfully on someone
else's code

342
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,230
and then once the junior engineers
achieve this to have a sense of

343
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,370
accomplishment

344
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,140
they'll feel like they're really getting
someplace lb confident when they

345
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,280
do for their endeavors

346
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,630
so it's also really important to give
engineers feedback on those goals and on

347
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,850
projects that they receive

348
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,720
I think a pitfall engineering is that
often we say well you could have done

349
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,520
this better

350
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,000
or here's a way that you can improve
which is really useful information

351
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,780
but equal useful is you did this really
well keep that up

352
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,929
that's equally good guide post for
learning and will help them

353
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:03,000
continue to feel like they're not a
total failure and engineering

354
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and reinforce their imposter syndrome
which probably a lot of them have

355
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,530
so arbitrary time to time period for

356
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,880
one thing that I do periodically is

357
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,100
review concepts that I learned
previously

358
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,970
in coal ever examine ball I'll say okay
so

359
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,090
here's what I remember about response

360
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,440
and I'll go after a couple of minutes
and saying everything that I

361
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,900
remember from the last time we talked
about it and then my

362
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,340
buddy my mentor my senior engineer can
say yeah that's really good

363
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,510
this chunk that you missed is also a
really important so make sure that you

364
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,679
keep track of that

365
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,179
so this it is not only for junior per
engineers personal development

366
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:52,289
it also gives them the input about that

367
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:55,500
chunks that didn't exactly sink in the
first time and if you're anything like

368
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,740
me there are many of these pieces real
get

369
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,000
a large chunk of the information the
first time and then some in the details

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,400
will dribble out the side

371
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,980
make sure you check in regularly with
your engineer it's really important to

372
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,210
you just give them an opportunity to
talk to you openly

373
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,610
and it probably seems pretty obvious
that they can do that but you'd be

374
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,580
surprised how much of a difference it
makes if you say

375
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,490
are you having trouble with anything is
there anything I can help you with it

376
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,789
kind of opens up the floodgates in just
give them a really good opportunity

377
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:27,580
give to give engineer offer and maybe
this is an opportunity now to

378
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,190
spend less time shadowing and have them
start co piloting

379
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,580
on a larger project with the more senior
person

380
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,940
so this is where they can take turns
driving

381
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,250
and if you went to drivers ed like ideal
then the person

382
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,130
who's more experienced in the passenger
seat has a secret emergency brake that

383
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:45,890
they can use

384
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,880
if anything goes seriously awry so they
get to you take a bigger

385
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,409
role in a project but also have the
safety of knowing that there's

386
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:58,070
someone who can help them when they get
stuck

387
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,039
so once you've gone through this
continue to check on

388
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,970
check in on goals and Taylor projects
and collapsed you

389
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,169
how they're doing it's a really
individual on organic process

390
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,600
so one-size-fits-all isn't gonna work
here

391
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,690
stick with the things that work and
remove the things that don't

392
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,549
so one thing this really is what this
point though is assertive in formal

393
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:21,360
apprenticeship

394
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,159
where a senior engineer take more
responsibility for junior engineer

395
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,150
and passes on the domain knowledge the
junior engineer gets bigger chunks of

396
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,159
code that they are responsible for

397
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:34,600
and they're really serve under someone's
wing

398
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,659
and this has the added bonus have
training the senior percent if they're

399
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:39,700
interested in it

400
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,590
to play a bigger role maybe in running a
team are heading towards management

401
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,419
one thing that we haven't really
discussed though is how you really

402
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:48,140
assess

403
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,340
how someone's doing or how you fix it if
they're not doing as well as you like

404
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,250
if they're on this middle trajectory
anything they have the potential to do

405
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,179
much better

406
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,010
how do you do that and really the answer
is communication

407
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:05,530
and let's say you talk to any find that
they're not really is confident

408
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,440
in their coding as you want them to be
often suggests an

409
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,610
an answer will lend itself to question
at hand

410
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,549
so if its confidence for example then
maybe you set them some

411
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,390
small quick wins that they can do to
make them feel like

412
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,409
they're really getting it or if they're
picking up some bad code habits

413
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:28,539
take a look at who their mentors are
they may be picking up some things that

414
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:28,789
are

415
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,049
okay for senior engineer who really
knows what they're doing but

416
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:34,830
habits you don't really want to instill
in your junior engineer when they're

417
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,230
straight out the gate

418
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,450
but do remember that not everyone comes
out the same this is an

419
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,850
eighty a finish line that everyone hits
but you have the power to set them up

420
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,780
on a better trajectory and I'm sure
you'll take that seriously since you're

421
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,480
here

422
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,710
but it's a good thing to remember I
would like to mention that the

423
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,169
last slide was technically incorrect I
for some reason

424
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:58,260
drew asymptotic lines as though that
people can

425
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,510
like never achieve anything above or
below where they're at and that's not

426
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,270
true

427
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,360
on cell you should just know that that's
lighters and cracked but

428
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,360
when you're thinking about the
assessment categories for people if

429
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,450
someone isn't performing

430
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,470
up to the standards that you think they
should be performing too

431
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,210
these are the five categories we came up
with to take a look at so confidence

432
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,970
code quality communication judgment and
technical knowledge

433
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,679
we've all worked with people who are
insufficient in one of these categories

434
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,419
and so it's important to realize that
it's not just technical knowledge that

435
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:30,260
people

436
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,510
need help on so a lot of times judgment
is super important

437
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,480
are they building the right things
because if someone is building the right

438
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,230
thing it doesn't matter if they take
more or less time to do it

439
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,909
they're going out to the right place at
the end of the day

440
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:47,059
so this is our coda this is my
contribution to the slides in case

441
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,200
you're curious the rest

442
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,059
markets responsibility an I'm burning is

443
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:56,110
problem like any other that we face in
engineering and it's really best solved

444
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,490
through

445
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:00,600
iteration and feedback and revision in
if you take

446
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,970
one thing away from this presentation
let it be keep the communication

447
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,150
channels open

448
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,510
this is the best way to ensure that
you're both on the same page and your

449
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,820
really getting somewhere but if you have
space in your brain for three things

450
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,230
lead PB is 6s is not just

451
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,600
being the most technically skilled
there's a lot of areas where it's really

452
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,679
important for people to develop

453
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,090
it really benefits everyone in the long
run

454
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,919
and everyone can be involved it takes a
village to raise a child

455
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,049
I'd like to think that it takes an
engineering team to you bring

456
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:39,490
a junior developer on board successfully

457
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,960
okay so hopefully you guys are convinced
to start improving your process now

458
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,029
one other things we talk about a lot as
engineers is code at we all know what

459
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,740
this is

460
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,169
and were terrified of it and I'm sure
all your companies have lots of it that

461
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:52,039
you are sad about

462
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,679
but people don't talk a lot about team
that or

463
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,840
management at which is essentially you
accrued at

464
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,919
with the employees that you have on your
team if you don't take care of them and

465
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,340
you don't pay attention to them

466
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,690
and so on morning is the first step and
making sure that you minimize the

467
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,539
steamed at

468
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,610
so that a year from now you don't have
people leaving because they got off on

469
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,409
the wrong foot

470
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,789
wouldn't have any help at the beginning
so we have a repo

471
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:18,860
I at this link where we have some
resources to get like give new people on

472
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,270
Python and Django

473
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,279
we have some other rubrics for assessing
others

474
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,529
am so if you all want any resources you
can go there and if you have questions

475
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:34,529
please ask them now thank you

476
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,520
thank you very much we have about time
for one question

477
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,230
I and I'm gonna have to walk over to his
Mike stand where people will see you who

478
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:53,230
so one question please hi

479
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,140
thank you at great presentation I was
wondering if you could talk a little bit

480
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,610
about adapting these techniques and
ideas towards disturbed him

481
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,850
that is a fantastic question

482
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,050
um one other things I say about scaling
a team is that

483
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,150
the thing you're scaling is actually
communication communication is its

484
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,490
the bottleneck great you have a small
team and everyone can talk to everyone

485
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,710
and as you grow that's not possible in
the distributed team I think

486
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,370
communication is really like the cock

487
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,430
that's the crux of what's going on i
meani people to be looking in Kate about

488
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,040
the process ease about what's going on
and all the different stuff

489
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,140
so am other things we talk about will
still work

490
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,470
mean you could have a virtual social
event I'm you can still have people help

491
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,710
set up Devin fireman's but I think I
think the biggest thing is really

492
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,880
focusing on the communication channels

493
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,080
because you're not going to be able to
get information to

494
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,510
to a more developers without that with
you

495
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:53,020
resource on our Repo Men helps code from

496
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,630
afar when your parent helps pair from
afar

497
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:59,940
when your coding there we go and see if
you check that out

498
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,430
I might help right

499
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,160
thank you
