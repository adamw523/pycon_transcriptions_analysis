1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,480
okay

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,990
hi everyone i'm happy to introduce this
wasn't an who will be

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,830
speaking about biking in the browser an
intro to brighten this

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,830
welcome her with a with applause and
higher

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,220
tight morning an

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,140
said is is my second I can and I'm a
first time speaker by time

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:34,140
so I'm really curious about the type
that saw for occupations in his audience

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,300
how many here

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,890
are full-time prime and buckle up
developers who use

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,070
jobs get day think

11
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,680
a said gee changes myself my name is
Susan am a recent college graduate

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,300
I ma Sudoku search contributor to number
pipeline projects

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,140
%uh in particular I open hash out our
Islamic era by jacks

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,370
I've previously a bus in May commits to
Django to a free market the iPad new

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:01,920
book

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,640
in which I redesigned E many bar in DUI
in the look and feel

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,979
I pine iPad dunno but version 2.0 I
previously I worked as a web application

18
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,130
engineer

19
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,979
at such terrifying two meters which is a
movie technology company in San

20
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:16,700
Francisco

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,369
so I every wish to retire to working
with John that over the past year

22
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:24,729
so I free was right before I can I love
my job so

23
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:29,500
now I hope I find out for higher so I

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,020
so if you are right on software engineer
in sears is going to talk to me after

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,509
its

26
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:39,729
gonna so it does it will be the first

27
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,229
presentation that you're here to talk
about a JavaScript library

28
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,189
in a python conference as you know
python is completely missing on the

29
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,079
client side

30
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,479
were JavaScript dominates jobs can is

31
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,630
appear exported in all browsers every
browser is a JavaScript compiler

32
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,320
so about half a year ago I discovered
this

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,409
brand new experiment a library card
berth on and here's a quick live dunno

34
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,800
so here I can

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,940
stored just a ball by numerical order

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,310
I can sorry my alphabetical order XO

37
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,599
by a twenty inspector omit up

38
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,110
at see 'em

39
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,120
ego to describe tag

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,080
instead of seeing a javascript script
tag you see a Python script tag rating

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,209
has been interesting

42
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,569
so I should engineers from France
decided

43
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,000
to create a new concerns Stice brand new
JavaScript library

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,640
because refrigerator they can use Python
to do client-side programming

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,000
so the this animated library

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
for people who dislike dogs cats so I am
very

47
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,900
early new user and this friend library
corporate bond

48
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,909
all talk about the use case for why
Piper your browser give a strong case

49
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:05,440
for it

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,340
I'll talk about some existing features
our breath on at compare

51
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,580
a to do list made in javascript and no
one made a brief on

52
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,340
over there is also some simple speech as
and comparing breakdown against both

53
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:17,860
Javascript

54
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,459
and Python all goood limitations upright
on a white

55
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,200
it still needs to work on and also talk
about the future of plants I Python and

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,830
jobs can

57
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,260
as a disclaimer I am NOT accord upper on
Python

58
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,989
nor do I use a slight for induction so
this is not going to be some adage about

59
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,480
why you should or should not use by time
duction

60
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,260
this talk will also not be about at
different architectural approaches in

61
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,430
making a Python implementation a browser

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,959
he's all really interesting topics but
free throws in this talk is mostly about

63
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,849
broken from a user perspective

64
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:50,959
so

65
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,909
who are the people who are most likely
going to you really want to have

66
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:58,840
Python in the browser I think they're
going to be friend and engineers I think

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,080
they're going to need a scientist and
engineers

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,670
and they're going to be engineers were
working in the intersection

69
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,540
as well and data have been

70
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,689
so indie scientific research

71
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:15,610
fields at the scientists are hilly
evermore

72
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,120
increasing amounts evita and the need a
way to

73
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,389
look at data in didn't in tractor way
and be able to visualize data

74
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:28,530
and in a meaningful way and overall

75
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,930
I'm this will really push the boundaries
of what can be downright fun and

76
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,330
what development as as you know dead
JavaScript d3 library is the most

77
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,900
a popular JavaScript visualization my
readers out there

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,080
and at its I'm a huge fan of the d3
library however I feel that it's fairly

79
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,350
limited to doing

80
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,160
a study expands and styling and of
course d3 is not

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,360
crew it was not created to do heavy duty
computations

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,729
a python it %uh trip up by that is
really popular ever do numerical

83
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:00,669
computations

84
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,220
so so why not in the future at can we
leveraged

85
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,050
pipeline scientific libraries to perhaps
create in

86
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,050
a competitive alternative or a
complementary tool

87
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,729
to the three JavaScript library so what
are the goals of this

88
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:18,550
Python your browser topic is 10
eventually create

89
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,800
instantly interactive our clients I D
wise like

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,330
that's power by Python and and why
should we need a live server

91
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,460
when potentially d entire

92
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,960
on computation can't exist on the

93
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,139
client site and just how to run in
browser

94
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,370
so this is a very challenging topic and
there are no

95
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,630
DR number of projects at a popped up to
solve this problem from a number of

96
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,490
technical

97
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:50,190
angles and so I'll be talking about one
of those projects

98
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,050
okay so just give some context DR number
%uh paid ninety dollars for compilers

99
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,169
these are yet the a listed some
stand-alone compilers

100
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,569
in a they're all in different stages of
completion and success

101
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,100
I dare to do it in browse
implementations us called

102
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,710
and bright on d32 JavaScript libraries
dot parse out

103
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,750
and do sources stores compilation

104
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,919
love I thank God at Scott is fairly
limited to running Python inside

105
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,229
a web browser consul in school does not
come with a damaged

106
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,710
yeah I to read that is the only project
and is less tax

107
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,080
not only has a DOM API so that we can
manipulate Asian art yes

108
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,080
elements but you can also

109
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,930
at have it load on peace out and said
the entire compilation process happens

110
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,800
directly on page lead

111
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,830
so I'm going to present a case for why
Python all images

112
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,370
she should be in a browser so by
valentino is more fun to read and it's

113
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,319
more readable than jobs good

114
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,180
and if you're in jobs given any capacity
you know that it gets messy and

115
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,280
unbeatable

116
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,280
fairly quickly even when you're writing
for medium-sized applications

117
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,990
at so fun is a search is urs compiler
dot

118
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,060
translates as high a level dynamic
language to another high-level dynamic

119
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,889
mileage

120
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,539
at break time has support for a good
subside at the Python programming

121
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:16,949
language including

122
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,080
features such as decorators list
comprehension is generators

123
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,410
programming in deep browsers possible
imprint on because

124
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,139
it has support for Don for a CG for Ajax
for

125
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,000
website the connections between the
client and server

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,470
also by program you buy than you can
circumvent the problems are losing jobs

127
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,319
care such as

128
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,780
at global variables and functions get up
and I think the most important

129
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,169
are powerful feature I thought it is
Donnie PI because without it on the PI

130
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:49,759
you can really make any blockages

131
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,520
so I'm just going to go over how to get
started when first time so

132
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,620
for should get the profound ideas file
Fondy source repository on the bucket

133
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,060
and then you include s brought on by
Jess file into a script tag

134
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,060
NiSource rectory dan you in bed I think
a inside the script tag

135
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,550
is the reserve does this reply damage a
python skin tag

136
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,289
danube I'll include aid I thought AP
body tag

137
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,599
that then invokes deep breath on my very

138
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,610
which then replaces all the perpetrator
in with JavaScript code

139
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,759
soon as I read it as a minimal sample
what you need to do to get right on up

140
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,169
and running

141
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,219
so not nixon just going over some a DOM
API methods and Python and compare them

142
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:34,649
against a Cray

143
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:38,250
an easy jQuery as a reference because

144
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,580
this is a really common JavaScript
library it's very much use in just

145
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,980
every model lineup occasional well so
indie cory Kennedy

146
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,959
selected on armies and attached I'd
syntax imprint on

147
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,490
you can import the doc model from the
browser package and an

148
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,620
ice lactis Donna amid using the back in
addition or you can use to get method to

149
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,940
do that

150
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,390
in Jaipur you can add or remove CSS
classes using the Add classroom if

151
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,709
possible didion proprietors Rd

152
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:13,430
names at the CSS classes in Perth on as
almost exactly the same syntax

153
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,260
in Jaipur you can append down on issues
India Penn function any

154
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,690
that can function takes 10 the name and
the new dad

155
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,690
at delivered don t want to create

156
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,769
in breath on you can create a new
development using dis is she a model

157
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:29,640
which comes up a number of methods such
as

158
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,360
did our table ally and all these methods
can take in

159
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,860
as a primary city name at the closet in
a min baad

160
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,029
then you can append a new Dave to newly
created a sound that uses

161
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,430
at rocking education

162
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,500
suppose you have a but in on a page and
you want to binding on click

163
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,839
event handler on this but how do you do
that

164
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,459
IndyCar you can bind you that using D
bind method

165
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:58,750
in which buying tix nd type other than
handler and also

166
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,320
the function to get invoked when an the
bite is cracked

167
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,589
so this case when one is like at to
hello just gets printed

168
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:14,060
to Roger birth on it's exactly the same
sit and you can use the Find function

169
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,709
local storage is the key value
client-side database

170
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,790
stars that persist for that particular
machine and ProductID tubular browser

171
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,390
in JavaScript you can use the side of a
method to static Ian value here

172
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,940
you can Gandhidham you get D

173
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,649
value by you speak enough to remove the
item

174
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,779
a in Python you can use a storage model

175
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:40,890
to you it accessible storage and you can
see the syntax is surprisingly similar

176
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,019
to that is

177
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:46,250
500 cherries

178
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,700
in primetime are you can also ask such
different JavaScript object in my

179
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,589
version brittan

180
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:53,829
using this jobs you might also this is
how you access the G core labor if you

181
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:54,459
wanna

182
00:10:54,459 --> 00:11:00,720
right Jacory are some other library just
library along with friends on

183
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,490
got so so now I know who ventured on the
planet it's

184
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,540
and if you're familiar with double scat
d quintessential hello world application

185
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,839
in the JavaScript when is the to do list
app and if you go to you it to do NBC

186
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,250
dot com

187
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,050
thing is he did a whole lot of examples
and different US after implemented from

188
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,269
different jobs can be /c frameworks

189
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:26,050
so here's a live demo

190
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,070
get so dizzy is it to do the job I can

191
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,940
added a number things

192
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,880
I can check them off I can delete items

193
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,470
because a clear to do items citizens the
jobs conversion

194
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,290
at the top

195
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:52,290
this is the brittan version at the I can
do exactly the same thing

196
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,519
and he can see a bad care but you have
to take my word for it

197
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,110
this is a rent an apt

198
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,829
so pretty much in is a recon at whatever
you can do with Javascript jQuery to be

199
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:12,269
much impact on

200
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,459
okay let's go over some result for the
time to us I use the iPod Nano Doug time

201
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:17,940
it module to run dis

202
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,000
my pump engine for a dozen times and get
the average up

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,560
in in Python there's no time in mind
also had to use the thai model instead

204
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,779
tad at to get the time it takes for some
children and then I use a for loop just

205
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:30,690
at a rate reduction

206
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,209
a dozen times are birth on is pretty
slow its

207
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:39,120
is Lord and either jobs report or Python
by 23 times

208
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,279
in another example operate on a slower
by

209
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,990
financial spread by 117 times in this
case

210
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,899
and is a serious limitation up it takes
time to

211
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:54,209
for president you do compilation from
500 jobs get there take time for jobs

212
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,300
get %ah so

213
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,399
interpret the JavaScript code

214
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,500
perhaps it is this year's limitation
because and this makes a huge difference

215
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,120
in to perceive a poor performance

216
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,089
have how long it takes for pages to load
and when you have

217
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:12,570
a very slow page load time dan bounce
rates go up and it's generally bad user

218
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:19,120
experience

219
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,250
this is the output Rd Brampton code from
the

220
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,459
up that first function agency did its
there's a lot of good I guess generated

221
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:31,139
from even a very simple for lip because
the

222
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:36,100
that for example Python uses its own
number object instead using javascript

223
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,449
native number object and an overall up
by thought is really slow

224
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,449
because it does not do you any
optimizations that you would still

225
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:44,029
expect

226
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:47,889
a compelled to do

227
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:51,500
okay so if a slow I use it

228
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,990
it having a slow jobs your labor can be
a big deal breaker

229
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,440
biting that breath on is the first app
or is it opens the door to

230
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,440
trading true for stack but applications
entirely in Python

231
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,610
a many examples that have seen in Python
are typically fine and

232
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,720
data-intensive visualizations

233
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,709
and at Burbank really supports a number
of core by the models such as math

234
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,199
daytime ijs on

235
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,420
at car models but and there's there's a
lot

236
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,690
murdered many other models that doesn't
quite a point yet

237
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,540
so because all the compilation is done
and %um page lead its

238
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,870
this makes for a very slow library
another's years limitation is at break

239
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,310
time

240
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,699
has no support for deep as scientific
Python libraries because most the

241
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:38,579
library's

242
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:44,519
are for in and see dealer in for trying
to make API calls to C Python

243
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,040
come is a disease really big limitation
because

244
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,320
if you want to have eventually to have a
fast

245
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,350
scientific Python in a browser dan
veggie somehow you had you'll have to

246
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,510
get the scientific libraries in the
browser

247
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,360
so so one potential solution may be to
just be right

248
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,079
old number I and i thought id and
included in incident proton

249
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:08,720
30 Traci any an

250
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,220
so I was annoyed at the fact that while
I was making to do list and I had to use

251
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,820
print statements everywhere so

252
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,910
I really wish there is so serve debugger
jewel like PDB in Python

253
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,600
Rd bug which one JavaScript like you
just like parts coder executions that's

254
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,740
something I wish list

255
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,170
for offers new library

256
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,160
okay so whether or not you want to
convince her employer to start using

257
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,680
this

258
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,949
new experimental library is really going
to be up company-specific

259
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:40,490
what is the business value and well as
engineering and project

260
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,649
to take it ballistic centers for

261
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:46,910
mean questions that much are usually
when I ask

262
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,300
as general guidelines 10 difficult what

263
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,060
how do you evaluate this brand new how
do about any brand new toy library or

264
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,779
premark

265
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,829
and the first question I ask is what
problems that's all

266
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:01,889
for Python at it's all been a problem
with putting

267
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,600
a it so many problems using dolls
favorites is neither additional

268
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,990
a friend and option to to code and

269
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,990
is it easy to use and learn I would say

270
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,459
it's fairly easy to get back on are set
up and running so

271
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,529
an says that I would say is it is really
easy to use and learn and

272
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,320
the documentation does contain lot
examples

273
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,930
who else is using it why and says a
brother is a very new library discreetly

274
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,670
in my knowledge no

275
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,680
up the bobek using Python so if you have
a user base at 0 it's kinda hard to get

276
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,089
other people to also use this tool to

277
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:42,250
and engine in general people the toll
that have

278
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,579
a larger Jimmy behind it will have
people who have more experience using an

279
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:45,910
art

280
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,699
be you'll have more documentation to go
along with this to a library

281
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,750
is in active development at for bright
on its it's just an

282
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,100
the releases come out once or twice a
year there's a breadth angle group for

283
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,320
people to

284
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,480
sign up and read what's going on and ask
questions and follow its development

285
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,539
and is required for it a library or just
any neutral to be an active

286
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:13,010
about me because you don't want an dead
the new tool to just fall over become

287
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,360
deprecated next day

288
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,150
okay so I just a talk about what's
coming up next for JavaScript

289
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,169
at .javascript six is coming up by
Ginobili

290
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,260
at but into the air to Firefox

291
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,510
and if you read the specifications I
love the syntax but in new dollar strip

292
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,130
sex

293
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,350
unit is that there's a whole time new
syntax a particular interest is the

294
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,669
syntax for

295
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:41,330
the JavaScript list comprehension
generators and the syntax rat looks

296
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,179
strikingly

297
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,850
similar to that to Dalit Python syntax
and it does not a coincidence because D

298
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,929
writers a job sex like directly ripped
out of from Python syntax

299
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:58,340
say JavaScript ecosystem is a very large
goings ecosystem

300
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,580
Dr subscripts a javascript and

301
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,110
up new languages that are trying to
solve the problem I've

302
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,710
how do you create very fast ap
JavaScript applications how you create

303
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,320
very

304
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,380
skillful jobs can applications

305
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,740
there's a wide your number up MVC
frameworks for doing client side jobs

306
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,880
for programming

307
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,030
and and they're all trying to solve
problem I'll how do you maintain

308
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,830
really massive JavaScript bases

309
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,990
right extra if you try to google top
fifty dollars go by various

310
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,039
ya got very many different options it is
a very crowded

311
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,690
messy ecosystem and it's really hard to
predict

312
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,270
what any day you will replaced all the
step in the future

313
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,460
but I'm I wanna make the claim that

314
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,990
if any labor o'toole were to replace or
complement JavaScript it would have to

315
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,289
be compatible with

316
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:55,410
the rest at the Johns computer system
and I also wanna make a claim that

317
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,480
dollar spent

318
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,390
but still the main issue and a point for
yet another five years

319
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,200
yet so the efforts own putting a fast

320
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,480
scientific Python in a browser is just
story disses ex super early stage

321
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,789
field and I think that all the efforts
to put

322
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:19,679
eighty %uh Python in a browser are
really going to push

323
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,200
what's possible left fine and web
development

324
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,350
operate on is just one project amongst
many other projects that are

325
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,900
in this at relatively new field I want
to mention

326
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,100
very briefly a number other interesting
projects

327
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,350
that are also trying to solve the same
problem

328
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,110
there's this new anti ld3 library dot
combines

329
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,530
both D map hardly a Python library with
died

330
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:50,080
deep three so it basically at generates
decreased JavaScript directly from

331
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,370
are not part led generated charts and
graphs

332
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,090
there is this very brand new pipe I dot
JS which combines

333
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,630
d aspects to de pie pie

334
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,299
compiler project a very fast Python
implementation with TM script in

335
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,360
at Seco to JavaScript compiler and

336
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,150
the person who's treatises its busy
trying to implement a.m.

337
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,220
de pie pie interpreter ref the jet

338
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,400
and distress we all die in JavaScript
with the help of in Skipton

339
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,900
a so so if you've ever used

340
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,100
matplotlib and if you try to plot a
hundred million day a poison apple at

341
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,490
Live

342
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,270
you read into memory she is and

343
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,919
do this new project out called this the

344
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,250
a pipeline project that aims to you

345
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,039
up solve the problem at how do you
officially handle extremely large

346
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,390
datasets and how do you

347
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,820
generate interactive visualizations fan
at both

348
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,549
static data and real-time data is
extremely light

349
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:57,559
said this be is based on the open GL a
project

350
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:03,390
a and its utilizing the computers cheap
user graphical processing units to

351
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,490
due out in real-time parallel processing
and data

352
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,900
and as you know the iPod Nano bug isn't
super popular it's

353
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,580
a game changer in the Python ecosystem

354
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,679
and I think the iPad the new book itself
represents a major step forward in

355
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,720
moving Python to the browser in version
1.0 it supported

356
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,980
static plots in the current version 2.0

357
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,360
people can now creates JavaScript based
visuals

358
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,510
banana bach and people can now

359
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,520
prototype JavaScript budgets and editing
and 43 into it

360
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,539
so does is pretty exciting times and I'm
really excited to see

361
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:48,429
like how these products will evolve into
next year

362
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:52,409
and when for his all brand new

363
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:56,530
and uncertain options but but when
Python finally comes to the browser in

364
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:56,850
which

365
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,850
ever she performed I'm I really sure
that the state

366
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,610
a friend about the bomb it will be more
richer more attractive

367
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,419
and be drastically different than it is
today

368
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:17,419
thank you

369
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,350
if anyone has any questions please
built-in microphone whether

370
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:30,350
any questions so i IC

371
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,830
a lot of talk about their compiling
certain things like pipe on into

372
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,880
JavaScript and having the JavaScript
engine in the browser on the image

373
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,270
is a clean solution because it can stand
alone but

374
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,820
I'm there are other approaches for
example he can there are

375
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,490
some a.m. projects out there that
interface

376
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,960
not a plugin to allow the I am a

377
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,640
a pipe bomb interpreter real type an
interpreter to run

378
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,140
in the background in actually can
interact with JavaScript you can export

379
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,550
its classes to JavaScript akin

380
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:08,010
poor JavaScript any jobs predominant a
pipeline have you explored any of those

381
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,020
kind of options

382
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,550
i havent exploiters options but a few

383
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:17,060
di haven't your name on those projects I
by I started one another another 1i

384
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,070
storm in a while back I think Tom

385
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,270
its own get pub in reply work at three
its specific to the I'm

386
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,370
WebKit ecosystem so that you some
drawbacks to it

387
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,160
but it's %uh it's fascinating because
you can interact completely with the

388
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,350
JavaScript environment

389
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,970
back and forth between Python and
transcriptome pretty seamlessly

390
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,900
I'll out thank you for sharing and your
okay on

391
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,700
hi thanks for talks is in arm question
goes into kinda similar action

392
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,440
in all the examples I've seen on on
Brighton so far

393
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,880
arm I don't see what the advantage as of
compiling Pythian

394
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,230
in the browser as opposed to pre
compiling its

395
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,930
to jap scripts and not having to deal
with that

396
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,450
on the client sites from great 0 about
the options and looked into

397
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,630
known as a stand-alone compilers have 8
da maybe I

398
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,500
that's built into it and and so I
handprint on is

399
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,690
it's really easy to get set out and like
running

400
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,170
and I i feel that it's is doing days a
little bit differently

401
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,750
then what the other comply project today
thanks

402
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,910
so on

403
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,590
you talked a bit about the performance
UHV are brought in and held serve

404
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,390
can sometimes be really slow and do you
have a sense of

405
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:38,010
love how much of that is kinda
fundamental limitation of the approach

406
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,770
this is how much of it is just well we
need to put in the work to generate very

407
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,730
JavaScript

408
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,900
others more amenable to the digital the
sorts of things

409
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,620
hmm I A N I'm not totally sure about

410
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,430
whether that's a fundamental limitation
by golly Kent Kent

411
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:57,140
is a possible today after mines first

412
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,140
hot front on to be really to be much
faster even daily

413
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,760
did semantics up getting pipe and it
just keeps exactly perfect

414
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,180
and Gnasher d exact answer to that well
perhaps a

415
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,240
sort of like questionentities is that
something that the broth and developers

416
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,670
a

417
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,470
working on adding those optimizations
yes yes there aware that

418
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,660
I'm

419
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,440
a thank you for talk arm us have a
common

420
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,850
about question just ask a like to
mention a

421
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,720
project that I contribute to its called
rapid script and it compiles

422
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,790
large Python JavaScript but its

423
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,350
has marva it's basically Adina

424
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,030
Python syntax is oscar's so you don't
need a EPI to

425
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,610
talk to the DOM I saw it has kept that
question

426
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,150
bypass I'm us have a question about
performance

427
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,630
compared to the other libraries a

428
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,430
Jeff numbers for skull Tom

429
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:01,500
pajamas the Jacka I and you have numbers
for

430
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,780
and performance at Firdos other
libraries and partially

431
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,080
thanks I

432
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,140
a thanks to talk on so the

433
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,460
I'd are you one of the biggest bears for
people using these news for

434
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,040
that's rough interpreters and
interpreters

435
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,010
is ours for the better debugging tool
for them so for example

436
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,200
on target at like the inspector for
dollars but doesn't want the best

437
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,450
angels out ever planted programming give
a sense that where

438
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,190
on things like that stand on the right
on road map is their plans and

439
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,570
one on at visit the things like

440
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,270
understanding what the an interpreters
doing my cat load time anything like

441
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,910
that I like really useful things really

442
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,550
for dollars I think up share so up

443
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,240
on on the user's ID can pretty much set
a debugging lovell

444
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,750
on and then at the pure bred Concord
itself

445
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,140
up and and other dorm or debugging tools
but that's really like where

446
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,660
that the limit debugging is really a
richer more debugging tools

447
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,820
in broken cool any more questions

448
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,990
okay thank you very much to send

449
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,340
the above
