1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,460
are we have to talks in this afternoon
session

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,390
the first one will be a forty
five-minute spots so that will translate

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,139
to

4
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:13,750
roughly 37 and minutes and 33 seconds
for talk

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,109
II and the remainder for questions so
I'd like to introduce Greg Wilson Craig

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,600
Wilson is the creator software carpentry

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,380
a crash course in computing skills for
scientists and engineers

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,619
his work for 25 years in high
performance computing

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,610
data visualization computer security and
academia in

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,079
and is the author or editor several
books on computing

11
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,870
including the 2008 drawer wardrobe

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,520
up winner beautiful coed and two books
for children

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,450
great received the PhD in computer
science from University vendor in 1993

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,440
and presently runs the software
carpentry project for the Mozilla

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,550
Foundation so %uh let's welcome

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,870
upgrade for his talk about softer
carpentry

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,539
and the lessons learned thank you

18
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:08,159
so there are the boring details what you
really want to do is hop on that if your

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,810
pad

20
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,220
arm that's what the pad looks like
please come join take notes and ask

21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,790
questions collaborate

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,799
so here's what we're gonna do we're
gonna recap a series of conversations

23
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,619
I've had and I'm gonna do both voices
because I have a little kid I've had a

24
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,350
lot of practice doing funny voices

25
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm and also singing the chorus love

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,210
the song from frozen over and over and
over and over so

27
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,460
1997 hi I'm a program I'm starting a web
company would you do

28
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,240
0 I'm a designer I know how to select in
range text and images in ways that are

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,490
appealing informative news about hot

30
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,140
that seems pretty simple to me I mean I
know how to use a fine selection dialog

31
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,829
I don't think I need to hire you few
years later

32
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,729
pumped into the designer so I just are
not go and tanked

33
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,649
people so that my site was agree in
confusing I guess I've learned my lesson

34
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:00,930
2014 hi

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,320
I'm starting an online education company
what do you do when a teacher

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,979
I know how to select and arrange
learning materials with repealing

37
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,140
informative interactive

38
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,860
har that seems pretty simple to me
retire you

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,690
welcome to my life here we go are in a
project called suffer carpentry

40
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,310
we r lab skills for scientific computing
this project started because I was

41
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,050
working

42
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,870
with his assistance to run misusing
first-generation parallel computers

43
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,540
and they would come into my office with
the 50,000 support when asked me to make

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,150
a zillion times faster

45
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,560
and they had never heard a version
control and we're

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,459
really sure why they should be writing
functions because nobody had ever talked

47
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:39,980
them

48
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,190
and his unfair to look down on people
who aren't doing things right if you've

49
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,530
never shown them how

50
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,489
I did anyway it's difficult to look down
on physicists but I managed

51
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:53,650
I'm but I realized by the mid-nineteen
ninety's that I was doing more harm than

52
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,390
good

53
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,250
if you give a supercomputer to the
average scientist it is rather like

54
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,659
giving a Ferrari to the average
sixteen-year-old

55
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,810
and the crash rates are similar so
starting in late 90's

56
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,989
we begin running classes to teach them
all that stuff that is boring

57
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,560
but works version control shell
scripting

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,750
how to marginal rise a program how to
manage data I'm

59
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,409
we don't have enough DT yet

60
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,220
to publish but the feedback we get is
that a two-day workshop

61
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,280
will save most scientists day week for
the rest of their careers

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,250
no to any faculty members in the
audience this does not mean they will

63
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,150
finish the degree earlier they will
still go to end the funding first 10

64
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,890
percent

65
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,450
but they'll get more done in the publish
more on the contactor problems that

66
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,099
could not tackle before

67
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,190
we teach the UNIX shell

68
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,230
get you can get help Python were or

69
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,230
ins SQL but what we're really teaching

70
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,530
his task automation how to track ensure
you work

71
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,330
had a modularized your code how to turn
it into functions that are readable

72
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,799
testable in reusable one that does in
fact all the same thing

73
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,260
we teach them a skill but what we're
really teach teams with structured data

74
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:05,720
is

75
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,129
what's a key want to know why do I care
so it's beaten switch

76
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:13,200
we advertise the things on the left
because they've heard those and will

77
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,860
show up

78
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,320
we teach them the things on the right
last year

79
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,060
103 instructors 97 two day event in 12
different countries

80
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,930
about 3500 people went through we're
going to increase all those numbers by

81
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,199
about 50 percent this year

82
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,759
so we're not huge but we're not small
and we're growing

83
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,120
that's where we've been and you can see
the numbers in the yellows but were

84
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,710
everywhere

85
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,229
and if you want to help community showed
but that's not here and

86
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,290
what I'm here to talk about today nor my
here to talk about all the volunteers

87
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,320
who make this possible

88
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,759
our instructors are volunteers post for
the workshop is the travel and

89
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,610
accommodation but they volunteer their
time

90
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,050
partly to make the world a better place
partly because it's more fun to work

91
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,290
with people who know these things

92
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,030
and partly because it's a real boost to
their careers

93
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,120
the academic job market is pretty tight
right now so if Trevor raise your hand

94
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,620
Trafford

95
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,530
who's one for instructors wants to get a
job at MIT going down in teaching a

96
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,330
workshop in Boston showing people just
how useful he is

97
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,419
gets his resume over the big stack and
short stack right away

98
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,570
so first thing I've learned

99
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,570
most scientists think a programming as
attacks they have to pay in order to do

100
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,350
science

101
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,410
this idea that we're gonna teach
everybody programming other organ wanna

102
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,070
learn

103
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,440
is wrong and we just need to get past
that

104
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,259
how many do home run apps I'm if you
enjoy doing home reno's

105
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:45,910
hey Chris out we put up his hand this is
a guy who enjoys refactoring make files

106
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,460
like

107
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,370
we're talking about way here on the bell
curve for most of us

108
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,580
hanging drywall is something we have to
get done not something that we really

109
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,979
look forward to

110
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,350
similarly if you take the average
chemist she could have chosen to go into

111
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,780
computer science

112
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,900
she chose to do chemistry that's what
she wants to do

113
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,660
programming something she has to do
along the way in the same way that

114
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,560
statistics is something she has to do
along the way

115
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,620
so we say wow this is really exciting
let me talk about recursion

116
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,180
we're not helping her I'm

117
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,680
the number two and this one took me a
long time

118
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,870
the curriculum is fall

119
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,580
every time we want to add something and
any level

120
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,800
we have to identify something to take
out

121
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
and right now I use this as an acid test
if you tell me we should have more

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,330
programming in schools my very first
question is what will you removed to

123
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,270
make room

124
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,880
if you're not willing to do that I'm not
interested in talking to you because

125
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,280
you're not being honest

126
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,669
yes I absolutely believe we should be
teaching programming in high schools

127
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:53,180
to give them less Jim so the more obese

128
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,910
do we teach them once about French or
English depending on which part of

129
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,940
Canada red

130
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,080
about we teach them once map right

131
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,250
we give them was music every time you
want to add something

132
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,030
you gotta take something out and if you
want to do this evening or weekend the

133
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,789
new cutting into all the things we
currently do with that time

134
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,849
and if you want to put more computing
into the undergrad program in mechanical

135
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:14,889
engineering

136
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,630
you have to convince a product that is
more important to mechanical engineers

137
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,660
education

138
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,840
to implement an Amex turn

139
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,199
if you're willing to do that the new
being honest about the challenges we

140
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,780
face

141
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,550
and this has been a real struggle for me
and this is why we run this two-day

142
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,599
workshops

143
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,770
outside the normal system our goal

144
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,300
is to reach graduate students and in
week fifteen years

145
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,729
so that they will rise up through the
ranks to their sitting on the curriculum

146
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,370
committee

147
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,930
and they can decide what to take owed to
make room for the stuff

148
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,610
this is how statistics became part of
the education in the life sciences

149
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,590
medicine

150
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,000
the generation that had to learn it
during the second world war

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,530
particularly in the UK under Norman
Fischer

152
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,240
fifteen and twenty years later when they
work on the curriculum committees at

153
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,660
Oxford and Harvard

154
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,539
and Cambridge in UC London they said
right we're going to take this out

155
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:15,410
and this was different in every school
so the people have to learn stance

156
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,229
you gotta play alone game I'm

157
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:22,710
I hate that idea I'm not by nature a
patient man

158
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,520
but this is how it works on you booking
police line

159
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,560
science advances one funeral at a time

160
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,830
Kirk but all the stuff is in the paper

161
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,990
go read the paper it short I think it's
well-written

162
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,729
and its open access so let me tell you
something useful

163
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,560
let me tell you some things that are
really in the paper

164
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,830
victory comes from the accumulation of
small advantages

165
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,529
if you want your workshops to work if
you want your teaching to work

166
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:57,630
there is no single slam dunk there are a
lot of things that can go badly wrong

167
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,470
but in terms which you do right it's a
collection of small things

168
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,880
how many do live coding when you're
teaching could no slight you plug in

169
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,510
you start typing do you know why it's
better

170
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:17,300
reason number one this the script why is
that better

171
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,399
they can see how to diagnose and recover
from mistakes

172
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,820
collateral knowledge transfer they see
what to do when it goes wrong

173
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,470
because that's never in the textbook and
that's never on your slides

174
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,029
ride they also get the reassurance of
knowing that a

175
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,680
if that the teachers can screw up it's
okay for me to screw up

176
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,330
you giving them permission heater pad

177
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,000
we always run a need to pack when we're
teaching there are students who will not

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,470
raise their hand for whatever reason to
ask a question but alas could

179
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,190
on any three-pound because my shared
note-taking recapture way to share

180
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,560
snippets of code

181
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,800
either petr something like it is the
best teaching tool I found in years

182
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,029
except for one other how many if you
teach was sticky notes

183
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:08,180
okay the next time you teach go and get
two pats a sticky notes

184
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,089
one red when green everybody gets too
sticky notes

185
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:16,140
when things are going well you have a
green sticky note on your laptop

186
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,279
when you need help you put up a red
sticking up

187
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,540
people who will not ask for help when
they have to do this

188
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,320
can just very discreetly say am as if
they were building a high-priced auction

189
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,380
from the front of the room you can
immediately see who's finished in neat

190
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,480
open redirect people

191
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,120
people's people with the shells it's
cheap it works incredibly well

192
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,600
it's a poor man's clicker do this

193
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,339
and you'll never go back we are teaching
workshops here on Monday and Tuesday

194
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,920
hands up if you're actually gonna
teaching one of those are helping have

195
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,300
one of those and we've got a few people
in the room

196
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,750
okay we are going to be handing out
sticky notes

197
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,140
and most of the people who attend those
workshops will then use them when they

198
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,880
teach

199
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,860
I'm it's a wonderful little technique
minute card is Tracy here

200
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,110
i'm looking straight into a bright light
tree city on the back introduced me to

201
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,180
this

202
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,779
so you've been teaching in the pin doing
sticky notes to ask for help which

203
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,140
number status

204
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,750
yes sir no we're ready to go on however
you use them

205
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,089
coffee break comes around everybody
takes the red sticky note and very

206
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,790
quickly jots down one thing they didn't
get one thing they didn't understand

207
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,640
in on the green thing one thing they
learned we put them on the table on the

208
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,890
way to the room to grab coffee

209
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,360
in room forty people pick Super two
minutes to go through those

210
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,570
so that when they come back from coffee
you know which part of the Western you

211
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,810
need to repeat

212
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,329
they won't come up and say I didn't
understand axe

213
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:43,980
and if they do it's 10 to 40 you don't
have that's representative

214
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,149
but if they do that on the way out and
they come back and say let's just go

215
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:49,899
over coal stocks one more time

216
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:54,720
they will thank you for it and you never
go back to the old way of teaching

217
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,670
signing up with friends we discovered
this by accident

218
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,440
and then I discovered the people doing
educational psychology research have

219
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,630
known this for about fifty five years

220
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,540
watch what I do with my hand so

221
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,260
our workshops used to have the same
crappy gender ratio that you see in

222
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,079
computer science undergrad class

223
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,829
12 to 15 percent female by accident

224
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:23,329
sort have we ran a workshop in London
where people were supposed to sign up in

225
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:24,870
groups

226
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,820
don't sign up as an individual round up
a few let me to friends and come as a

227
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,800
group

228
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,660
gender parity why

229
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,750
you but when I guess

230
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,430
you know the answer in bed in the back
there

231
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,279
less scared because you know that you're
with people you trust

232
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,300
even if they're not also from the
underrepresented group in somebody's got

233
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,760
your back to somebody you can turn to
for help

234
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,550
you're not going to be the dumbest
person in the room cuz come on this

235
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,240
issue let me

236
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,410
you know they're stupid issuer in so

237
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,839
the work on this was done in the early
nineteen fifties trying to get

238
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,639
recent immigrants particularly Jewish
kids in New York to sign up for sports

239
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,019
activities in neighborhoods

240
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,980
even if they're not signing up with the
Jewish kids the fact that they know

241
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,829
those people in trust them

242
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:15,339
makes the at risk under-represented
groups more likely to show up

243
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:18,459
and I hope of the size but cannot prove

244
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:22,380
that one of the reasons we slow down or
teaching over the last two years

245
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,570
is that we're actually finally reaching
the people who need our help

246
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,540
most because the underrepresented group
in our workshops used to be

247
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,139
the people who really didn't know how to
program

248
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,519
and they were free to commit to
programming workshop because nobody

249
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,290
wants to be the dumbest in room

250
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,860
but now they're showing up with other
people who are just as backward

251
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,350
through their K so do group sign up

252
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,769
I promise you will increase diversity on
several axes

253
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:54,670
editors are hard things that

254
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,329
we take for granted are really hard for
them

255
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:02,329
into the biggest mistake we make

256
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,459
is to use the word just

257
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,519
how many be used the word just when you
teaching

258
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,070
really please stop right it's the
passive dismiss objective

259
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,209
oh yes you just install a virtual
machine and you just installed Ubuntu on

260
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,170
topic that would just make sure it's the
right version of Ubuntu and then you

261
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,079
just synchronize the

262
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,910
network card so you can just transfer
data network

263
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,930
getting editors to run getting to
understand

264
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,990
a text editor which is different from
something with word

265
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,920
and how to save files in the root
directory so they can find them to run

266
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,880
them

267
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,290
is hard because it is intrinsically hard
it just we've been bitten by the so

268
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,589
often that we've got so much scar tissue
we can feel the teeth anymore

269
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:49,199
with production that there was something
there to learn and this is part of what

270
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,070
we do with our instructor training is
try to remind people

271
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,740
that there is something there that needs
to be learned we are one other note if

272
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,930
you're organising workshops

273
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,040
make sure the russians remarked

274
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,250
cuz it the you can dress that story
tells itself right

275
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,350
the other party that story is make sure
the campus security knows you're

276
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,649
supposed to be in the room

277
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:13,880
you can fill in the rest about brief but
exciting story as well

278
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,550
his lesson for and have I could send a
tweet back in time

279
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,750
five years a ten years Intel myself
something

280
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,940
this is what i would tell myself as a
species

281
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,060
we actually know a great deal about how
people learn how to teach them

282
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,730
there is as much evidence-based research
in education has risen medicine

283
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,880
the differences you're probably more
where if the research in medicine

284
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,620
when you are the research in education
if you can do one thing after the stalk

285
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,870
going grab a copy that work and read the
learning sciences group Carnegie Mellon

286
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,949
put this together

287
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:55,110
this is a summary as of 2010 for
non-specialists were willing to read

288
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,519
dense taxed up what we know about

289
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:01,750
cognitive psychology educational
psychology instructional design social

290
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,970
forces shaping

291
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,060
learning this it's the everything we've
got boiled down into one book

292
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,100
it is not an exciting read menachem back
to doubt

293
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
it isn't an exciting read but it's a
really useful when happen if you have

294
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,740
kids

295
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,079
please yes and the kids in the back put
up their hair

296
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,720
excellent working I really like

297
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,360
knowing enough about education to fact
check my daughter's teachers

298
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,519
in the same way that I like knowing
enough about medicine to fact check my

299
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,940
sisters oncologist when she was sick

300
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,750
how many here in a startup do you like
knowing enough

301
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,430
a boat tax law business legislation
commercial property

302
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,820
that you don't have to take the Warriors
word-for-word

303
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,300
you don't you don't have to be an expert
but corman

304
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,110
250 pages that's a good investment of
time

305
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,310
so footnote to this lesson is most
programmers

306
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,009
and most people in business and most
people in government even ones that are

307
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,699
really excited about teaching

308
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:07,760
don't know that this knowledge exists

309
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,850
it was a lotta social forces around that
we can go into in question period

310
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,169
but the ultimate answer is that we have
heard work on some time so you never

311
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:16,970
fart

312
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,010
most programmers would rather spend a
week remote hacking on a new mic website

313
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,110
Fernan our reading research papers to
discover that the pedagogy embedded in

314
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,079
the website

315
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,220
is actually useless I'm not mentioning
any

316
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,620
platforms by name contradictory but

317
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,530
what too many people are doing

318
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,470
is taking bad teaching an accelerating
it by putting it on the web

319
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,980
rather than finding it would good
teaching is and then exhilarating

320
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,679
that

321
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,840
let me give you some examples and the
slides will all be up

322
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,090
I'm sorry for the long URL but I'll come
back to this and watch the piston to pad

323
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,280
really good slideshow from a few months
ago

324
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,039
from John Hattie in New Zealand what he
does

325
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:09,789
is collected Studies in Education into
the mysteries on top of that

326
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,880
so his database has almost 200,000

327
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,900
studies from the last half-century on
various teaching and learning techniques

328
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,410
and what he does is look at what is
called effect size K basically

329
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,730
what fraction of a standard deviation
can you attribute to this thing

330
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,780
now for those of you who don't know as a
very very rough rule a farm

331
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,760
each grade in the public school system
is about one standard deviation up from

332
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,919
the one before it

333
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,360
so think about these numbers as
fractions of the year

334
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,580
in public education his primary looking

335
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,270
he's not interested in tertiary
education adult education

336
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,340
so with those caveats let's have a look

337
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,280
shifting schools cost you $30 per year
with nothing else going on

338
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,320
moving a kid return prime sticking to
another cost members third if you're in

339
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,640
the education

340
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,630
it's disruptive could web-based learning

341
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,720
the effect is so small that it's just
not worth worrying about

342
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,320
teacher subject matter knowledge turns
out to be relatively unimportant

343
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,919
misery love farm you looking for bro 2.4

344
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,750
to get excited anything below 0.4 your

345
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,850
not to worry about it teacher subject
matter knowledge you don't have to be an

346
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,720
expert to teach

347
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,280
and in fact we from a softer carpentry
is it's better if you're not

348
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,200
because experts don't remember when
officers don't know

349
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,520
what about class size people get really
excited about this

350
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,730
it turns out there's a week a fact

351
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,380
when there are problems that are
attributed to class size they're usually

352
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,730
do something else

353
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,510
take a look at the bottom one there
strongest effect found

354
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,390
to improve learning is to get rid of the
disruptive students

355
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,830
and much love the miss attribution to
class size

356
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,309
is simply a reflection of the fact that
a larger classes more likely to have

357
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,230
disruptive students in it

358
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,010
if you can control for that the class
size affect goes away

359
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,159
that's interesting motivation

360
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,250
K motivated kids

361
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,309
learn faster

362
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,789
I'm we're a concept mapping to simple no
picking technique where you draw

363
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:22,380
pictures and the ideas the relationships

364
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,020
K would appear to drink getting the kids
to teach each other

365
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,230
I mean if you care program can come in
if you pair learned

366
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,280
even informally look at the price you
happy year

367
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,340
that's a pretty cool thing formidable
valuation for teachers let me give you a

368
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,320
scary statistic

369
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,770
in the canadian and american public
education systems

370
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,630
the average teacher has another teacher
in his or her classroom four hours a

371
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,470
year

372
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,520
in the Finnish school system the average
teacher has another teacher in his or

373
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,919
her classroom three hours

374
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,960
a week a movie play a musical instrument

375
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,059
how much to learn from having another
musician listen and give you feedback

376
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:07,850
how many feet do a sport even if they
know better than you getting the

377
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,419
feedback cleanup and repair if I some if
you get code reviews

378
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:16,130
the rest if you please don't record for
me okay

379
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,679
it's a normal practice in some school
systems isn't in English language school

380
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,610
systems

381
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,090
look at the effect size right it's one
of the top five

382
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,090
how canst teachers improve if they're
not getting feedback on the teacher

383
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,179
there is a commercial site no could be a
smart cookie dot com

384
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:36,289
teachers can post videos of themselves
teaching to get feedback from other

385
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:37,900
teachers

386
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,049
this is brilliant this is absolutely
brilliant it's like

387
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,010
YouTube where people posting videos and
songs playing guitar to get feedback on

388
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,130
their playing not on how good the song
is put on how will be doing the keyboard

389
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,950
in from work

390
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,010
K this is what the internet is for

391
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,409
to look at some other things

392
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:02,350
there are broadly speaking and I am
going to generalize my father taught me

393
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,669
never hesitate to sacrifice troops for
clarity so I'm about to do that

394
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:10,190
basically three mental stages with very
clear divide between them

395
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,510
novices do not know what they don't know
they do not have a mental map it the

396
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,679
terrain

397
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,010
they don't know what the key concepts
are with the relationships are so if you

398
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,679
give them what's up know what you were
actually pushing them further back

399
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,289
because what they're going to do is take
those facts and put them into the box is

400
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:28,360
that they've got

401
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,010
but those are the wrong box is how many
viewers 38 a programming class you've

402
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,850
been wondering helped us okay

403
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,610
you know the people coming in and asking
the questions and the questions just

404
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,500
don't make sense

405
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,370
that's why they've taken the knowledge
and they try to fit into the existing

406
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,600
model of the world and that models one
but they don't know that it's the only

407
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,530
one that got

408
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,030
so the most important thing with novices
is not to give them information

409
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:56,260
its to give me correct conceptual model
in or have to the introduction to Unix

410
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,789
we teach them exactly fifteen

411
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:03,590
Unix commands in three hours but we
teach them the paper and filter model

412
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,940
we teach them history we teach them how
to read a for loop in the show which is

413
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,590
not to say things in shell script

414
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,669
we teach them the file in directory
structure so now they've got a map above

415
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:15,059
the terrain

416
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,679
they knew where the pieces are in how
they're supposed to fit together in them

417
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,289
they can fill it in with knowledge
faster than I can talk and you're

418
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:21,030
discovering

419
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,070
I can talk pretty fast

420
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,780
second stage is competent competent
practitioners can do normal tasks

421
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,860
normally that's where most people stop

422
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,850
how many be drive a car look at you
probably a normal drive

423
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,850
ride I mean helicopter gunship comes
swooping in but a bit about you don't

424
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,740
know what to do

425
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,010
normal situation right happens in the
movies all the time was come also

426
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,840
restore

427
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,919
happens less often in Canada right

428
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,010
summer Europe from the state's drawn
capital of the world okay

429
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,390
competent practitioners are the middle
to curve

430
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,400
what distinguishes experts from
competent practitioners

431
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,799
it is not how much knowledge they have

432
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,370
no but how's that reflect what is
experience turn into because you can do

433
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,860
things over and over

434
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,970
what different sheets the expert is the
density of connections

435
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,610
in relationships between the fact that
they know

436
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,830
think but in terms of the ground if your
graphs personally connected to go from

437
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,080
the idea you've got

438
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,620
to the idea you need to solve the
problem might be five parts

439
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,330
but for new me who got a much more
densely connected graph it might only be

440
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,980
one or two

441
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,299
and this is why experts are usually bad
a teaching novices

442
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:37,600
because for the expert idea a an idea no

443
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,549
are adjacent there's a link for the
competent practitioners

444
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:46,000
a two-seater hope LeBron opposite aid to
be

445
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,100
overdue said to cuba y back 2c 2d

446
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,270
the can't see the jump they don't have
that link

447
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,330
K all you teaching has to be based
around us

448
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,210
you have to know which group you're
talking to

449
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,679
the most important thing to get from
competent expert is self reflection

450
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,900
as far as we know you do not become an
expert with the reflecting on your own

451
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,799
practice

452
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,980
again how many few code reviews

453
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,779
pic I do not believe you can become an
expert programmer with ok

454
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:20,970
reviewing your own code any more than
you can become an expert musician

455
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,070
without learning to hear yourself

456
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,000
so if you wanna make that transition
what you have to do is teach company

457
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,870
people have to look at each other's work

458
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,830
how to read and critique somebody else's
movie review how to tell somebody

459
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,890
that their shoulders with rushing on the
swimming whatever it is

460
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,390
so that they can apply that technique to
themselves

461
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,990
close the feedback loop and become an
expert

462
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,260
okay everything I have to strip told you
is backed up

463
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,850
by hundreds and hundreds of studies this
evidence behind with routier's more

464
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,380
quickly

465
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,380
how many can appear instruction peer
instruction is a teaching technique

466
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,460
which probably produces better results

467
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,650
in less time here's how we do it

468
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,929
thing number one i ask you multiple
choice question and you all have to poke

469
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,020
you got

470
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,070
you know ABCD or colored cards were
clickers

471
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,350
case you poke committed to an answer
step number two

472
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,090
you talk to your neighbors little groups
3&4 trying to persuade them that you're

473
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,470
right

474
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,450
step number three you have to vote again

475
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,640
stepped in before I tell you with the
right answers and now they're step

476
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,860
number five

477
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,150
you get to talk to your neighbors again

478
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,440
if you interrupt this process after each
state you discover that almost all for

479
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,000
learning happens in step number five

480
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,270
wine because in the discussion with you
three

481
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,760
you realized why he believes the wrong
answer

482
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,000
so in the second round of discussion you
can correct his misconception

483
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,429
it gives you the power of 121 tutoring
in a scaleable fashion

484
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:55,700
look for a written answers work we have
twenty years

485
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,580
evidence to back this up but Simon's
work at UC San Diego has replicated two

486
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,539
studies with several hundred students

487
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:05,460
over the course of five years none of
the existing platforms directly support

488
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,549
construction

489
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:10,840
and most if you don't use in classrooms
when you teach because you've never seen

490
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,929
it yourself

491
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:16,770
okay this is kind of cool

492
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,320
I got him is what I have to accelerate
multimedia channel company persons for

493
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,640
concert extra some was mostly okay

494
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,559
here's the most importantly I will come
back if there are questions train your

495
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,429
trainers

496
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:31,960
K I now run it class to teach people how
to teach programming

497
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,210
the next one starts in June its online
tell me

498
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,360
this is the one thing i really wanna
showed about not only

499
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,279
do people learn how to teach they learn
how their colleagues are going to be

500
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,020
approaching the problem it doesn't
matter what your PlayBook is it matters

501
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,850
that everybody's

502
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,940
on the same page i'd and yes there is a
great deal you can learn it does improve

503
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,820
things

504
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,649
you can go there teaching to suffer
carpentry .org or

505
00:27:56,649 --> 00:28:00,789
you can go there we are running a class
on Monday

506
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:04,039
gonna try to squeeze a few key ideas
down into one day

507
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:07,700
they're still succeeds open if you're
interested I will put the Euro up again

508
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,270
but I to speed up here's bus number six
by country didn't matter

509
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,899
okay I've been teaching for sixteen
years I have never met anyone who

510
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:17,679
switched appointment because I anything
in Python 3

511
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,760
it did not bring us a single new user

512
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,270
what we could have done that would make
a tremendous difference to my teaching

513
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,350
other than fixing the installation
problems which the working on we should

514
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,600
fix the standard library

515
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,690
watching novices try to find things in
the standard libraries

516
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:36,850
Weser always stop after maybe assure you
tiller maybe it's I don't know fred

517
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,600
ride string I oversee string I on the
list goes on and on

518
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,440
most importantly we should have done
some usability testing

519
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,760
under stuff etc published a paper in
2011

520
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,309
my love this work can sorry about the
crappy formatting

521
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:58,659
there's the borough are posted up what
he did

522
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:02,230
was compare how readable programs are

523
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,289
to novices who've had brief instruction

524
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:10,899
in three programming languages pearl
quorum

525
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:17,370
which is one that they're designing and
one with a randomly generated syntax

526
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,539
people given pearl performed just as
badly as people given language with a

527
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:25,539
randomly generated syntax

528
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:28,600
in the internet responded as it always
does

529
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,620
people went to the trouble with looking
up his students names in order to some

530
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,020
hate mail

531
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:39,250
and one of them drop to the program's
result you can guess her gender

532
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,960
k if this is how the internet response
to me doing research promoter K

533
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,730
what's interesting in those comments is
the people who are saying

534
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,899
you result in statistically significant
twitches response is yes they are here's

535
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:56,429
my data here's my statistical analysis
beauty is less than 0.05

536
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:59,860
it statistically significant where
people really means I don't want to

537
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,770
answer the free must be wrong

538
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:05,480
so he went back and he read it that
study

539
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,070
but he turned up the volume step in
seabird

540
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,200
are you can find copies at that if you
google for it

541
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,460
the idiots abuse him put everything
behind paywalls

542
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,799
you can read the so let me give you high
points

543
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,659
step number one is go through with lists
of words and terms and symbols to ask

544
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:24,630
novices

545
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,210
which ones have these do you think mean
the following things

546
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,399
interesting discovery in a list of 20
words

547
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,380
the ones the place bottom for meaning to
this multiple times

548
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,840
or four and while they are the least
likely

549
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,730
to novices to mean repeat things because
for means do it for somebody else in

550
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,120
while mean something to do with time

551
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,490
nobody guess is that means repeat if you
change it so that the key word is

552
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,279
repeated

553
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,309
people find the concept easier to learn
because they don't have to unlearn the

554
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:55,860
old meaning

555
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,450
that's a step 1: bus to step 2 once
people have had a big construction

556
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,700
language

557
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,720
let's see the accuracy with which they
can identify construct in

558
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,789
rebbe Java prepay fun random 0 that's
the round one and core

559
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:13,929
note that every feature in corn has been
a be tested before two-putting for

560
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:17,039
language

561
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,450
languages will see style syntax do not
go perform a randomly generated

562
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,830
languages

563
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,029
pearl in Java both sucked as much as
random

564
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:31,669
Ruby and Python who performed in Coram
outperformed both

565
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:36,120
gosh isn't that interesting how many
people web sites

566
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,370
how many to usability testing and web
sites how many to usability testing on

567
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,840
your language

568
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,240
how many people were seen a usability
test attached to a PAP proposing a

569
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,010
change in the price on language

570
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,159
why the hell not we can do it

571
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,820
and building more usable language k last
thing because it's time for me to wrap

572
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,120
up

573
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,970
would you like me to buy you and the
person of your choice dinner

574
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,570
convince me that you have an answer to
the following question:

575
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,190
why the hell do we write lessons that we
read software encyclopedia is

576
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,190
how many you contribute to an open
source project

577
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,260
okay so we know from hundreds of
projects that you can have thousands of

578
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,019
people over the course of a decade

579
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:17,980
contribute small bits and pieces to
improve something

580
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,340
how many if you have ever edit Wikipedia
page

581
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,820
okay so we know that we can have
thousands of people over the course of a

582
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,830
decade or more

583
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,840
collaborative we create something which
is complex

584
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,390
and readable read the Wikipedia article
on the causes of the American Revolution

585
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:38,960
its beautiful prose it explains concert
complex things and had several hundred

586
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,269
contributors

587
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:44,100
how many people have ever seen a lesson
or lesson plan

588
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,799
that had more than three offers more
than 10

589
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:55,019
more than 50 yep olivia is a note lawyer
here I'll be talking to you later sir

590
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:58,570
why don't we do this

591
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:03,090
now I can understand that this was
nineteen ninety-five nobody at flattered

592
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:08,640
but we've had Wikipedia as an example
for what a dick in hand

593
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,159
you can't say it's because the
technology is hard been teachers may not

594
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,899
be programs but they can edit Wikipedia
articles

595
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:19,100
you can't say that it's because there's
no benefit to the teachers themselves

596
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,179
I really like being able to take
somebody else a slider can't we could

597
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:23,929
use other peoples exercises

598
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:27,620
you can't say that it's because people
are afraid to put themselves out there

599
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,980
on stage this is the Internet

600
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,880
right it was invented so the people
psychological disorders could get jobs

601
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,750
right get respect from the community but
every single thing every single reason

602
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,960
you can think of why

603
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,440
teachers and other educators don't
collaborate on the construction teaching

604
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,309
materials that we we collaborate on code
with other people collaborate on

605
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:48,990
Wikipedia

606
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,110
every single one of those points equal
to these two cases

607
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:56,169
and yet despite dozens of attempts in
different countries

608
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:59,419
and by different communities I don't
know with anything

609
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:02,750
like Wikipedia los materiales things
like CNX

610
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,960
are up with the slide decks with the
people can download it there is

611
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,800
no merge there is no culture of
contribution

612
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,119
if you want to change education but
really change education

613
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,790
expand right

614
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,030
that would be cool so this is me

615
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:27,730
and there's apparently some 16 updates
available so one should just ignore them

616
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,129
thank you ample okay so I suffer
carpentry dork

617
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:35,030
all of our lessons really get a free
porn we get people talking K

618
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,399
there's another protocol the
architecture open source applications

619
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,530
and we are current lease looking for
technical reviewers for things call 501

620
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,990
zealous let me wrap up

621
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,929
please ask me but the scraping sprint
with just me but the turtle sprint to

622
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,419
please ask me but indeed if

623
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:55,419
please ask people 500 lines thank you
very much

624
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:03,180
okay thank you we actually have even a a
minute or two more for questions so we

625
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,690
have a mic back here

626
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:09,320
anybody who wants to ask questions arm
maybe about why there is no

627
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,160
are Wikipedia for to a lesson plans any
of that please go back to that

628
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,520
microphone and will take questions

629
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,660
and also scripted MacBook should put
those on one slide

630
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,730
certain time pipe

631
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,839
how can I make you look better hi Greg
you already have

632
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,349
but %ah um you how you can make my life
better

633
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:32,950
the whole send me right here thing only
kinda freaky go ahead

634
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,020
trip %ah

635
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,020
I think the first time ask your question
%um poke fun at my glasses services

636
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,130
par for the course um

637
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:48,820
are so I was wondering if group sign ups
could be used

638
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,990
as a mechanism for addressing the gender
parity issue

639
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:58,240
with our regards to conferences so I
propose this first type II boat

640
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,599
up for various financial reasons I
wasn't able to happen and could be a

641
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,790
play that their

642
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,670
I could it don't happen up I can't do
the experiment in report back

643
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,910
quite quite seriously yep we can make
arguments both ways

644
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:14,140
more and more a pensar que no te
Scottish verdict is

645
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,190
okay juries in Scotland are unique in
the english-speaking world in that they

646
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,960
can return one of three verdicts

647
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,190
innocent guilty or not proven

648
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,230
increasingly I think that we should
adopt Scottish for two more cases than

649
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,040
we do

650
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,720
we don't have evidence it's plausible
argument try it and tell us if it works

651
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,190
get rate literate okay who's up next

652
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,880
hi thank you for great talk I I teach
programming to teenagers

653
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,280
I have been so for about a year with the
number from the Bay Area we recently

654
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,050
tried adopting

655
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:47,589
pair programming one of the main
challenges I fine with teenagers

656
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:50,800
is are so none of them know each other
before the course

657
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,349
and teenagers are very much iz they're
very hard to mention pair sometimes one

658
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,970
will get

659
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,160
stuff at the speed of light yet when
will struggle uterus which bears around

660
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,530
but then you just

661
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:04,320
have to lay the problem other group is
kind of hell to measure teenagers

662
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,250
and used you've already identified the
problem we don't know each other coming

663
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,310
into the room

664
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,730
yes okay fix that and the other problem
go away

665
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,880
and thank you pictures hidden bolivia

666
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,030
so I disagree with the statement that's
known the on-screen

667
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,190
is so if you go to math Academy don't
org am

668
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,470
that's a website that's powered by get
help on the back and

669
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,920
soup anyone can contribute and that
shows

670
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,280
lesson plans in a graphical qua and you
know

671
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,960
you can plan your course so many people
here have seen math Academy .org annuity

672
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,940
just make Academy

673
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,150
sir meta medicare to me my apologies

674
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,369
so that's my first attempts at getting a

675
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:48,290
free dinner okay you you don't have of

676
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:52,400
of winnowing you have to explain to me
why this isn't normal

677
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,180
ready shown that you can do it with
heroic effort and you have put in her

678
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,359
work effortlessly don't know prolly
eight

679
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,500
he deserves a round of applause as well
but none you have to convince me you

680
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,700
know why this has not

681
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,470
normal is just starting its just people
figured that's the right way to do it

682
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,720
Paul anyway this is just a temp number
one you can leave lol we can decide

683
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,920
attempt number two will come when this

684
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,140
being that is film now will be put up on
YouTube

685
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,060
or and then later on someone built a
course on course era

686
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,000
that tries to get lots of people to use
tools like that so at that stage

687
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,829
out of tens hundreds of thousands of
people

688
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,140
maybe you know a hundred 200 300
teachers

689
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,900
actually start using those tools K and I
first heard this is just around the

690
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,410
corner

691
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,460
in 1996 right K

692
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,270
and so I don't believe it's just around
the corner I believe there is a force

693
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,740
acting in the other direction that I
don't understand my model the world

694
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,010
predicts that this should be the normal
thing

695
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,329
it is not a normal thing so I'm wrong
about something there's something I

696
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:54,780
don't understand

697
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,480
K and people again and could just
convince we have the tools now to make

698
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,670
your we had materials

699
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,280
we have the tools as long as it's been
Wikipedia stay tuned for a temp number

700
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,680
two perfectly sir

701
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,440
so I just went in open space just before
his conference on education

702
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,329
and I am amazed that's you brought up
the same point that I

703
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:16,400
brought up where and concerning
translations actually because

704
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,869
agreed that we don't have any with book

705
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:23,750
as programmers its easy to collaborate
but as educators and fork on and we

706
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,040
don't have any platform any good yes we
do

707
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,960
it's called Wikipedia the other will you
just work on its not for education

708
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,369
course appeal earn a period the end the
Learning Commons there have been dozens

709
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:36,910
attempts to take exactly that's offered
popping up in the teachers to do this

710
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,230
and that

711
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,740
all failed at least all the ones in the
english-speaking world I cannot speak

712
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,800
for the communities I would love to know
if this has worked in

713
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,020
you know Brazil South Africa China
someplace else that I can't see into

714
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,510
because my language disability

715
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,859
well I'd say that to him worked at all
because we don't have any platform

716
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:52,770
translate actually

717
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,940
into have any good plan from a Trembley
content Inc on

718
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,260
demanding okay okay that's a possible
technical issues go

719
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,420
um so I wanted the Python code ads and

720
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,060
one other things we have is for love
this stuff

721
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,609
if we want to take any of this feedback
we have to go hunting for it

722
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:15,290
in academic papers all somewhere else

723
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,579
come talk to us the and mailing lists
are open

724
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:21,829
yes we can be an asshole sometimes but

725
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:26,460
sometime in yes something I'm on the PSF
listener

726
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,810
the BSF is not my thing that

727
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,359
a and and BSS getting better too to al

728
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,599
but it it's the thing I love okee its

729
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,730
there is wonderful stuff we should be
doing um

730
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,140
but we have no money we haven't known
resources but we

731
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,790
and but he beat you coming to us for
teachers to

732
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,599
so I heard teachers why aren't high
school math teachers

733
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,010
who have rock-solid curriculum in
fixed-point problem

734
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:59,050
doing this now they opted to the same
text books a white card

735
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:03,240
the doing this rights not just for
programmers why our social studies

736
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,200
teachers not

737
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,170
collaborative billing West plans because
they're used to using other people's

738
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:07,680
material

739
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,240
you really have to build raw material
most people teachers don't

740
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,319
they take standard material improvise on
topic then with jazz musicians improvise

741
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:15,790
on top

742
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:20,190
score so the idea that we have to build
all this ourselves

743
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:24,589
I with the idea that it's a technical
challenge I'm still not buying dinner

744
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:28,220
but yeah I think you permit incentives
II back it being in sentence

745
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,680
okay I might like to take a crack at the
dinner the case of all the arguments

746
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,980
saying they don't have incentives
applied equally well to open source and

747
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,930
I was there

748
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,790
in the eighties and nineties when people
were saying open source will never take

749
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,470
off because why would anybody give away
software

750
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,550
they have disincentives to via the
Internet okay

751
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:51,550
please

752
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,150
but

753
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:05,150
absolutely

754
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,590
we point

755
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,610
social studies teachers in Ontario apt
an instance the week

756
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,740
the week media software and sister
Camille pin their I'm not

757
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,180
I'm not looking at this is a
programmer's or programming problem

758
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,160
I it is routine now for teachers to

759
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,740
not just use that headed Wikipedia
articles

760
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,850
in the process a building course
material take a look at who the

761
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,590
contributors

762
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:34,320
are so why are they not taking exactly
that and doing it for less it but it's

763
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,270
not about programs

764
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:41,990
yup

765
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:46,240
in again we can find point solutions

766
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,810
why is that not normal okay

767
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:56,330
okay and that's the challenge is why has
this not already become just the normal

768
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,230
way of doing things

769
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:01,700
okay I'm sorry she's got a couple
examples like CS unplugged

770
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,140
where there are people clambering on
curriculum the open source text book

771
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:05,730
that

772
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:09,030
different you know this contributed to
there are a few points solutions that

773
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,770
are a few instances there is nothing
that has been widely used for has spread

774
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,920
I'd it says that the only open source
software

775
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,720
in the world was going to you max okay
now I'm depressed

776
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,580
ok that was a bad vision I

777
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,420
okay the argument that was the teaching
us to localize

778
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,720
I'm sorry have you looked at the Common
Core might have you looked at sent we

779
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,690
mandate a teacher

780
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,310
okay I'm so we're gonna have to go to
the next one but argue with me

781
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,930
afterwards I'd love to buy you dinner

782
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:46,270
that came out so wrong go ahead please
please his microphone please use the mic

783
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,640
yep okay so I'm at the chart but I miss
you then

784
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,030
and I can tell something up from a
different perspective

785
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,860
a because at my school when I lost high
school

786
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,150
I am my teacher muffs the shower

787
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,740
deter organize something like math comp

788
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:10,140
and it was like mmm dark done by
students by us for us

789
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,200
it was like we are totally into it I
mean we take we are seeking part into

790
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,200
not signed yet it was also like a

791
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,260
in computers in computer science but

792
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:26,710
the we students the just found out about
the topics want alarm there was a group

793
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,500
of people

794
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,050
could I mean those students it was not a
school it was very important

795
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:35,380
and that we went somewhere with our
teacher

796
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,500
it was like free as calls from

797
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,570
my country and it was like from them

798
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:45,480
a very morning deliver evening enter its
were

799
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,920
running short on time so is the question
were proposal in

800
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,070
know is like it way well internal to
bury you

801
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:58,810
call us: well minotaur so the book that
has changed my mind about teaching the

802
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:01,920
most is seeing like a state hands up if
you've read this

803
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,330
hands up if you work in a large
dysfunctional organization in those two

804
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,280
words are the same

805
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,370
okay this is why over and over again
large organizations prefer the allusion

806
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:15,630
a central control over productivity for
success

807
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,520
think booklet device for me understand a
priest 1:20 a.m.

808
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,560
as much food brigade Moscow the Aleutian

809
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,830
that everybody's doing things the way
they wanted think about softer

810
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,980
development at IBM

811
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,690
I lived through that was
indistinguishable from click device for

812
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:30,980
me

813
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,910
so this is a really good book and their

814
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:39,490
case after case after case and what we
see with centralized curriculum

815
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:43,100
is that we have to squeeze out the
individuality which actually leads

816
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:48,100
to better performance so I'm so I
understand bad as a possible argument

817
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,290
what I don't understand is when nobody's
managed to break past that an amount of

818
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,050
time on time

819
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,840
okay ladies and gentlemen thank you very
much at all just burning rubber
