1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,800
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,560
to the second session on the security
track this afternoon

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,559
it is my pleasure to introduce dan
Callahan from Mozilla

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:14,940
we'll be talking to you about quick wins
for a better website security

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,940
a big hand thank you

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,720
so what I want to do with the stalk is
give you a very broad

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,140
overview of techniques some Witcher
really

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,820
rather underutilized that with minimal
effort

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,760
you can use to dramatically improve your
site security going to talk about

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,350
security in three domains

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,690
when you're transmitting content when
your rendering content

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,760
and when you're storing content uploaded
by users are

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,600
generated otherwise the most important
thing you can do

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,000
to improve your website's security when
transmitting data

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,940
is to use a cell this has been a pretty
rough year for SSL

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,109
in 2014 Apple had the

17
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:07,610
the double go to feel bug which wouldn't
be possible in Python because we have

18
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,760
significant white space

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,640
arm but unfortunately have not yet taken
over the world

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,610
this short-circuited certificate
validation on I owe us and

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,990
Western devices and then just last week

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,360
a bug in open a soul refer to as her
bleed was disclosed which

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,689
leaked private key material force to
remove million sites on the internet

24
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,880
which is also not an ideal situation

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,869
from if you're running a teaser site
over a soul please go

26
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:41,200
update your search in her book the old
one but seriously

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,960
you need to use a cell because as the
souls the only widely deployed

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,240
technology the only tool we have to
protect

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,460
data in transit from you shoppers and I
see that what I mean is when you

30
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,680
normally go to website

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,219
say your bank dot com we take that into
your browser's address bar and hit

32
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,009
return the first in your browser does

33
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:03,700
is presumed be mean to it attempt to
connect to you the

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,140
in security each EP only version that's
a beachy pecans lash lash pink dot com

35
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,319
statements under clause that says hey a

36
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,690
bank give me your index page and several
usually respond if it's a banker some

37
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,160
other secure institution like

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,290
Hacker News or get hard with the
redirect it says actually please go and

39
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:24,830
talk to me

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,709
on port 443 me sleepy ass my secure

41
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,150
my SSL version of my site 00 resubmit
the same request to wrestle

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,480
get a response back and you actually
have content you're off to the races

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,030
of course with each request your brother
is going to send cookies as

44
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,190
browsers do you for that domain
fortunately by using a cell

45
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,769
um you protected in case

46
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,849
sorry baby messed up the transition

47
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,910
a mention attacker in between you in
your bank

48
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,819
if using us all your protected in case
attackers listening

49
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,819
your communication because everything
over the SSL secured link

50
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,980
is imprinted the attacker without
knowledge of

51
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,870
your service keys which partly from

52
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:17,870
I know has no idea what you're actually
transmitting to that site or with the

53
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,959
responses

54
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,810
but that first round trip that

55
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,680
connection to the HTTP the insecure
version inside is still visible to

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,799
anyone is listening units on the scene
at work

57
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,370
were between you and say you're trying
to reach and with that request

58
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,190
game session cookies normally when you
log into a website

59
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,470
so we'll set a cookie that identifies
you be some served

60
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,879
long may be a sign string in a cookie

61
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,810
and if you can see our cookie I can copy
it they can impersonate you on that say

62
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,030
because that's what the site when used
to identify you

63
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,110
for subsequent request a a little while
ago someone actually weapon is this in

64
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,959
Firefox

65
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,610
and create an extension called Firesheep
they did you really beautiful sidebar

66
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,909
with the big start capturing button when
you click that button would listen

67
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:12,840
on the local network and look for any in
secure a bust

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,579
that had a cookie cutter with the
session cookie

69
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,350
and give you this wonderful really easy
use menu

70
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,530
all the accounts you could just hijacked
by cloning that cookie

71
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,590
and sort one click you to be logged in
to Facebook ur Twitter depart as someone

72
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,720
else if you'd seen

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,889
love a request that they sent over HTTP

74
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,610
before they got redirected to the SSO
version of the site

75
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,300
to using us alone is enough because
there is still that initial

76
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,590
in secure a quest and the way you can
mitigate that

77
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,550
is we're using secure cookies so
normally the way a browser will

78
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,080
what's up the cookie from website is in
the responses there'll be a hater called

79
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,610
set-cookie:

80
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,840
which has a key equals value parameter

81
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,400
if you pander to the into the header
some econ space

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,430
secure you construct the browser to

83
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,360
only transmit that site or the cookie
back to the site

84
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,530
if it's communicating over securelinc
the attacker would still be able see

85
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,240
that initial request and response

86
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,449
but the session cookie wouldn't be
transmitted along with that first

87
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:18,460
request because

88
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,259
was marked as secure

89
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,050
however if the attacker can see button
for pasta response

90
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,979
be very well may be able to tamper with
it the commodified a request

91
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,330
they can modify the response you can't
really trust anything coming back that's

92
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,610
not secured over link

93
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,410
with SSL as a real-world example imagine
going to bankamerica duck confit take

94
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,610
Bank of America duck on my web browser

95
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,639
hit return I go through a series of
three requests

96
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,530
to rear experts like that HTTP
bankamerica dot com

97
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,600
that redirects me to dub dub dub Bank of
America com

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,740
which then redirects me to https

99
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,919
doctor dub bankamerica dot com salud
that bank's website

100
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,740
I had to go through three requests into
redirects before hitting a secure

101
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,250
channel

102
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,490
an attacker if they were able to you
insert themselves into the middle that

103
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,419
communication

104
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,960
could potentially alter that redirect in
simi to you a malicious domain say bank

105
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,080
0f America dot com which could be a
legitimate do mean

106
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,780
with a legitimate SSL certificate but
it's probably not that I mean I intend

107
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,990
to visit what's worse is the attacker
could decide

108
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,259
instalove just modifying the redirect
they could just serve you wholesale

109
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,539
it completely fraudulent copy the
website and never forger cost on

110
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:43,210
whatsoever again if I'm not you taking a
rest so I can't really trust

111
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,300
where the data is coming from or that
hasn't been tampered with

112
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,120
the Electronic Frontier Foundation has
published a blog article urging

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,830
what sites to use as a cell and in
discussing this

114
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,110
it provided a screenshot of Internet
Explorer 11 looting

115
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,690
the Chase Bank website both over a
legitimate secure connection

116
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,199
in over a hijacked in secure connection

117
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,000
and were things that if you can modify
the response if you're an attacker in

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,949
that situation you can change the
favorite icon

119
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,789
say to the icon of a lock and when you
load the page you end up with something

120
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:17,050
looks like this

121
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,669
and how we view in this room are certain
that you know which of those to you

122
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:26,449
screenshots is the secure version of the
site

123
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:31,430
and how confident are you that your
friends and your colleagues

124
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,099
would be able to detect the same and
avoid

125
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:41,849
logging into a proficient site

126
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:45,150
so what can you do how can you prevent
an attacker man in the middle

127
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,349
from serving up an altered a forged copy
per side

128
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:53,099
if they can observe that first
transaction if they can modify the first

129
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,990
transaction

130
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,530
and you can do abuse extra Transport
Security

131
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,940
so we're going to make america I went
through three requests the third being

132
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,840
the only one that was finally on secure
channel

133
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,870
if I go to get Hobbes even if I type

134
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,190
explicitly HTTP not s just http://

135
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,840
get a dot com and hit return my brother
only makes one request and it makes it

136
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,780
to the secure version of that site

137
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,330
its able to do that because in every
secure a sponsor the Gibsons on every

138
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:24,650
sponsor

139
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,349
arrest assault it's in the header called
strict Transport Security

140
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:32,830
let her little bit like this you provide
the max 8 answers

141
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,419
for the next in seconds

142
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:43,950
remember this domain in only attempt to
connect to it over SSL

143
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,110
and what allows you to use it allows you
to completely eliminate the first in

144
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,980
secure oun trip

145
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,500
you don't have to get the redirect your
brother knows but it should be talking

146
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,670
over SSL

147
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,990
you can complete your move that initial
and secure channel of course the very

148
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,730
first time your brother has to learn
about

149
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,370
that her somehow to the very first
coaches still has to happen but only has

150
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,160
to happen once

151
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,630
for all subsequent connections saw your
browser's cache hasn't been

152
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,170
cleared to be over secure channel

153
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,300
Firefox and Chrome also ship built-in

154
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,580
a list of preloaded sites that have
opted in to stir Transport Security

155
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,959
which helps bootstrap that system and
get you to your bank slip cider

156
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,790
to Gmail or to you get Harbor without
concerned for

157
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,320
maliciously get that first up

158
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,370
super transmitting data Michu using a
cell

159
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,040
to print you shoppers from monitoring
your content

160
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,360
should you secure cookies to ensure that
someone on the same network in person at

161
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,580
your users

162
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,589
and you should use to transport security
to ensure that

163
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,320
user actually meeting with your site and
they're doing it over secure channel

164
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,200
very easy to set up again secure cookies
usually just a single

165
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,339
configuration line most web frameworks
as a sole

166
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:05,730
as usually minor copious copious guides
were saying about Patch your engine x

167
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,950
ray us

168
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,990
sir transfer security gets a single HTTP
header to dramatically improve your site

169
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,120
security

170
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,700
we're not rendering even though we've
been selling cookies even sing them

171
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,930
securely

172
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,700
so they're not visible to that use
dropper if someone's able to inject a

173
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,269
script into our page

174
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:25,959
they could still access the document
that cookie property and retrieve

175
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,660
the text to that cookie and then the
good X will treat that

176
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,769
that session ID and send it to some
militia server and then

177
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,110
impersonate user that way

178
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,399
the way you can mitigate against the
sort attack

179
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,800
is we're using HTTP only cookies no
person should be sanitize your input it

180
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,220
should be possible for someone to get a
scripted your page

181
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,640
but suffers hard things happen

182
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,089
in the same way that we added the secure
token to our cookie

183
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,610
with an attitude called HTTP only which
instructs the browser

184
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:03,160
to not actually make that cookie
available two scripts on the page

185
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,720
its tone requests your web framework can
still see this can still read it

186
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,180
Django in flask will do this by default
for their session cookies

187
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:16,459
but it's protected from malicious
scripts on the page

188
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:20,660
but again you have a problem if there is
a malicious script on your page

189
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,730
and what can you do about that

190
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,329
a relatively recent addition to all
major browsers including

191
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:33,269
including Internet Explorer is support
for content security policy

192
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:36,899
this is the single most important slide
in the stock which is not a widely used

193
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,019
technology yet

194
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:42,240
and it should be water content security
policy will let you do

195
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,720
is a stylish the whitelist I've every
single external resource

196
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,860
and where can actually come from on your
site

197
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,310
this could be things like font style
sheets script tags images

198
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,630
videos anything that you can embed link
out somewhere else and CEO Gopal this

199
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,829
from

200
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:03,720
cloud from Drupal is from a maxi DNR
bridge rap CD and

201
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,040
in a content security policy can a new
marine saved by default only allow

202
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,070
things from self

203
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,170
which means the same domain the same
origin as the current page

204
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,470
or allow images from the same origin or
to be made directly with the data

205
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,630
protocol

206
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,470
or prints and scripts in this directive
last group related from the same origin

207
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,690
or from AP I dot example dot com

208
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,040
this allows you to create district
whitelist to completely innocuous

209
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,850
yourself

210
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,630
against injected scripts there's a
special directive I think it's

211
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,709
unsafe in line or something for in
sitter in line scripts

212
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,370
if that's not there if your browser sees
this content security policy and then

213
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,480
runs into a script tag in the middle of
your page

214
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,519
see just alert hello world it'll look at
that it will check the security policies

215
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,529
will see that that's not be valid

216
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:54,339
police first trip to be coming from
that's not something you expected

217
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,040
and it will ignore it completely blocked
her from looting or from executing

218
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,250
missus incredibly powerful of course
like this can be hard to add to existing

219
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,019
sites

220
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,160
so there's a sister tag called content
security policy report only

221
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,399
you can send with the same parameters
and what that will do you

222
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,410
is allow you to continue with everything
working

223
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,430
and whenever the bros would normally
block something with a policy allow it

224
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,820
to loot allowed to run

225
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,850
but will also log message to developer
Council tell you that

226
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,060
you hey this policy would have allowed
this thing to run are you sure you don't

227
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,470
wanna just a policy to you

228
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,440
within or maybe move your script to a CD
and somewhere that you do allow

229
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,810
and take an audit your partner's
translate for a sport a given policy

230
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,279
if you doing these five things you doing
extremely well

231
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,420
especially if you have a content
security policy again this is

232
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,810
relatively new has broad support in
browsers

233
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,540
Internet Explorer still requires a
prefix and has a slightly restricted set

234
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,019
of directives that it supports

235
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,310
but broad support this is your best
second line of defense

236
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,570
after because you have good inputs and
is Asian making sure that things are

237
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,380
coming from re expect them to you

238
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,829
nothing else can you a CSP can you

239
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:12,480
what you the other three other 100 you
can set the provide additive security

240
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,750
in different as a turkey since you can
set free martians

241
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,420
instruct the browser to completely deny

242
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,230
premium your page say I can't you know
I'm not allowed to listen i've room

243
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,560
sorry science not going to loot your

244
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,889
this will prevent clickjacking attacks
you may have seen huge water bombings

245
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,139
like

246
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:35,240
I believe is not a year ago where a site
had looted

247
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,260
a Twitter page with the pre-filled sweet
ex in a big Tweet button

248
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,910
in iframe said invisible and then put
that on top of

249
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,839
Sumter gamer some some other buttons so
when you click you think you're clicking

250
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,620
on this button below but you're quick is
really hitting this invisible iframe

251
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,540
and sending a tweet extreme options then
I'm

252
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,139
will prevent that from being possible
Django super the middleware that will do

253
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,510
this for you by default

254
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:06,000
a flask pyramid do not you can also set
same origin as the directive to allow

255
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,060
other documents on your own domain term
but that

256
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,310
that page or if you need to allow
betting on other domain you can set

257
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,180
allow from

258
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,370
the given your eye free single domain

259
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,550
importing that's not as widely spread
across browsers but if you do need to

260
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,579
allow embedding the site

261
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,420
in a frame somewhere else that's better
than nothing for browsers that do

262
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,510
support it

263
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,980
you can also set exercise protection so
are exploring chrome support

264
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,870
her called X assist us protection
witching Sutter one mood block

265
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,199
with elders will use heuristics to look
at the scripts that's about to execute

266
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:42,699
if it looks like that's good maybe
vulnerable to some server floated cross

267
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:43,880
site scripting attack

268
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,600
but sees query parameters reflected
inside the script itself

269
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,660
it'll simply prevent that script from
executing

270
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,250
again this isn't spur across all
browsers but its a very powerful tool

271
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,459
as the third line of defense if you're
centralization your content security

272
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:58,329
policy

273
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:02,139
somehow allow something to support
through lastly you can disable mime

274
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:05,230
type: sniffing some browsers will look
at the first you buy to a file try to

275
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,670
determine what it is

276
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,449
regardless what content type it sent als
which could be to you something you

277
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:11,360
intend to be

278
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,680
plane taxed being misinterpreted as HTML

279
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,360
and come to be you the start was static
turning into active

280
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,509
live scriptable content you can disable
that by setting the ex content type

281
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:23,070
options

282
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,120
new sniff header so

283
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,899
again 300's plus content security
policies

284
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,680
and you've dramatically improve your
site security all the sanding hunters is

285
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,750
like one line in middleware

286
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,769
very very easy to you dude in single
afternoon

287
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,990
what store India their two principles
and restore user

288
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,240
generate a deal the first is to
completely Eisley evening

289
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,180
that is coming from users if you're long
upwards at sea images for

290
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,680
avatars or other content you need to put
the content on a separate domain

291
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,079
not on your mean to me not a subdomain
you mean to me in but a completely

292
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:00,430
separate domain

293
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,509
you'll see this Google recently moved
although get her paper sorry

294
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:07,319
group moves all its content to you to
use our country dot com and get home

295
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,480
recently moved

296
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,579
all the get HubPages content to get held
up

297
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,150
I O and what that does is it allows you
to avoid some

298
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,329
esoteric session fixation attacks where

299
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,350
content on that demean might be able to
execute as if it was appear

300
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,789
to your own legitimate content and us
touch local storage or set cookies on

301
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,169
behalf of the user

302
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:30,970
by isolating on its own or under mean
its own origin

303
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,000
you're not at risk for those words
attacks

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,080
the other principals to avoid storing
data that you don't have to store

305
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,210
if at all possible don't use passwords

306
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,730
their number federated login solutions
social things like that happen Twitter

307
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,860
up if get hobby is appropriate to your
audience they also offer login

308
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,539
solution I work a muzzle on and I worked
on the personal project which isn't you

309
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,700
know based

310
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,250
walkin solution that doesn't required
site-specific passwords

311
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,580
the general prince was you can't lose
access to data that you're not storing

312
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,360
of course is important when you're
looking authentication system to balance

313
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,820
the need to view user's

314
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,910
so forcing everyone through Twitter get
home

315
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,860
might not be ideal because he might not
be willing to give your site access to

316
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,320
those

317
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,980
to choice of some sort of neutral you
know based while this is my other person

318
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,250
or judicial your password system

319
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,440
but providing alternatives to a
traditional password based

320
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,770
authentication system

321
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,929
will lower your your servicer your risk

322
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:33,059
lower the severe yunis or compromise you
might might experience

323
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:37,340
so in summary when transmitting data use
a cell

324
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,770
to ensure that you shoppers can see what
you're transmitting set secure cookies

325
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,150
to ensure user sessions can be hijacked

326
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,830
set strict transfer security hunters to
ensure your users are actually talking

327
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,500
to your site

328
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,450
and doing it over us all by default

329
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,059
when you're entering things make sure
you set HTP only cookies

330
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,260
so that malicious scripts can get access

331
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,780
to user such information User Content
Security Policy different

332
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,059
malicious scripts are injected scripts
or other content from leading on your

333
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,330
page if you don't intended to you

334
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,150
supreme options to work for checking
turn on axis us protection and a stable

335
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,010
mimes nothing to avoid other esoteric
attacks

336
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,870
I sleep content generated directly by
users to its own domain

337
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,090
if you can all boarded don't store
sensitive data that you don't absolutely

338
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,660
have to you

339
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,049
now before I wrap up I wanna point every
one to two other resources that are

340
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:34,580
absolutely phenomenal the first is OWASP
the open web application security

341
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,970
project

342
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,510
that can be found at a wasp .org and
it's our wiki based encyclopedic

343
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,070
reference

344
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,280
top 10 lists love major vulnerabilities
explanations a

345
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,160
what the problems are how you can
mitigate them developer cheat sheets

346
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,880
it's a really fantastic resource the
second his qualities a sellout

347
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,370
site at a cell labs dot com

348
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,419
you can point there'd tester to your
domain

349
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,400
in all give you back report card on how
well your demeanor supporting us a cell

350
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,330
what cipher suites using doesn't support
per perfect forward secrecy

351
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,429
is vulnerable to heart bleed and

352
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:12,669
information for how you can improve your
deployment vessel

353
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,679
the fantastic resource so that

354
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,559
but you are agree about five minutes for
questions and later dropped the one that

355
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,780
has questions to the mike

356
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:27,780
in the back corner but you

357
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,070
hi arm so if chrome and firefox are
shipped by default

358
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,159
with our what sites use strictest

359
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,820
our transport security and to avoid it
first potentially loses connection

360
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,179
arm what what exactly does the h

361
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,360
guess everywhere a plugin do so

362
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,530
HTTPS Everywhere which is a Firefox and
Chrome extension

363
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,070
there may be other browsers where that's
published by your truck Frontier

364
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,030
Foundation

365
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,299
is kind of like and opt into you a
sulfur sites are currently setting the

366
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,049
header have adopted into you

367
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:04,140
the preloaded lists so the brother since
you can use

368
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,210
on your computer to say he please avoid
this

369
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,289
first connection anyways the AZT yes
header is a way for the site

370
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:18,620
to do that for everyone okay

371
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,330
hi I I was curious when you're talking
about

372
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,530
making cookies ATP only that scripts
just can access them

373
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,710
I was wondering if you have a javascript
have the application that needs to do

374
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,610
a JS based off arm is that going to
interfere with that at all

375
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,679
I'm you should always be performing some

376
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,340
partner authentication on the backend
server

377
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,610
and the cookies will be some but that
request for normal and ship your tree by

378
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,559
the request

379
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,450
if you need to retrieve the cookie
princeton's in Django the CSRF token

380
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,110
is sent in a cookie that is not each DP
only by default you can turn on/off

381
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:01,559
per cookie as needed go

382
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,020
what's the way other recommendation for
browsers to try

383
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,360
aged BS before in an encrypted
connection

384
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,470
I probably just history from there a
lotta misconfigured sites

385
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,690
particularly if you RC naming out to
some other service and it might support

386
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,840
us all but

387
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,880
a up until recently a solder church in
being

388
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,520
one IP per site and so things could just
imagine the web to break when would

389
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,580
otherwise work

390
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,020
if their mobile site on single host for
instance

391
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,510
you mention log into the console for our
report only mode in

392
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,360
have you seen people doing plugins are
other types of extensions to

393
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,440
forward for the report on to the server
itself so that we can get tight

394
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,470
aggregated logs but what's breaking your
what's what's working

395
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,000
and we were actually is a a directive
you can

396
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,280
add that will do that I didn't have a
chance to you look at the only

397
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,230
ran across reviewing slides I would look
at the last page

398
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,900
and I'll tell you more otherwise I'm
sure their extensions out there that

399
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,340
will

400
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,370
gather that much

401
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,520
any other questions thank you so much
