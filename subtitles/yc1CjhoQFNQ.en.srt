00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,010
Devlin please welcome her Friday

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,670
a burger Japan Catherine Devin govern
you I see docs run run docs ran

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,330
I hope that came out right that's all
the French I got but time

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:22,109
thank you I'm all these slides are
already online at tiny URL

5
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,680
slash run docs run and I will give that
URL again at the end

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,470
and it has links to make it have repo
and everything else you gonna need to go

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,250
that's the only part that you need to
write down you don't even need to write

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:32,840
it down yet

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,260
so the stock is on execute about
documentation which is a term that I

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:37,930
just made up

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,660
to better define it i'm talking about.
documents that poet in real living code

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,250
and execute that code

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,700
and the results so that execution either
validate or get incorporated

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,969
into the document when you generate that
document or refresh that document

15
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:58,859
or even when the reader is reading the
document as for what a document is and

16
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,379
what you think

17
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:02,550
really brought me here so I can get away
with being in the education track

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,360
I yeah i'm talking about. I wrote this
package here's how you use it

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,270
but I'm also talking about educational
documents like here's how you learn to

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,020
program

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,229
here's how you do this science problem
here so you do this math problem

22
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:19,140
or organizational documentation here's
how you request a new laptop here's how

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,560
we do our builds

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,340
here's how you request funding to come
to Pike on these are all kinds of

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,170
documents that can actually

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:33,170
benefit from having code embedded in
them wire we bothering our docs perfect

27
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,780
well docks and perfect on Bundchen
problems with them

28
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,090
this doesn't address although many
dresses summer them one of the big

29
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,659
problems

30
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:45,640
is inaccuracy that results from
forgetfulness you think okay now I'm

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,210
gonna write the docs to do it works like
this it works like this

32
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,350
and you've already forgotten summer the
details about the program works in you

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,649
right

34
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,799
inaccuracies in or it was accurate to
begin with

35
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,469
but then time passes the code changes
the organization changes

36
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:02,540
and you forget to update the documents
also

37
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,549
there's boredom most first love to Cody
it really engages our brain we get

38
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:07,850
focused on the problem and we

39
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,590
with do a fairly good job writing code
and documentation is more like a chore

40
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,780
we can resent it and that boorda me
shows through

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,670
and the boredom spreads to the reader
and just not that engaging or relevant

42
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,569
are fun to read

43
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,489
so what we end up writing is historical
fiction

44
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:27,709
it wasn't even true to begin with is
progressively less true

45
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,870
and nobody's interested in reading it
now

46
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,980
I've never read this book but it sure
looks like it sucks

47
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,940
so

48
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,870
coating your documents can help fix this
problem both in that

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,790
the document can become self verifying
the document lets you know when it's

50
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,230
false

51
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,330
or the document cannot be false because
it's pulled straight

52
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,780
out have live working code also because
it's Cody your brain will re in gage

53
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,870
it wakes up it gets back into the
problem its write something that purse

54
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,280
relevant and that you care about and
then the reader will end up caring about

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,390
it and the quality of your documentation
will improve

56
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,629
sir to illustrate all this

57
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,290
I'm going t I made up a fake little
package called argument clinic and we're

58
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:11,870
going to just

59
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,680
run through how we might document up
some users samples and checking on the

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,000
software requirements

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,430
we're going to do that with four
different technologies

62
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,590
and because that's a lot to cover gonna
be going fast the examples are going to

63
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,470
be really simple

64
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,680
but I want to cover some the basic
boilerplate abusing each of these

65
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,769
and then you can decide what might sue
your project to the oldest one is doc

66
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,440
tests this goes back to a previous
millennium

67
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,000
lost wisdom of the ages the idea docked
s

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,069
is simply that your arm your your doc
strings can and should include usage

69
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:44,659
samples

70
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:48,280
though should show the user how to use a
piece of code in what the result

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,189
should be that they can expect now in
this case here's a piece of code

72
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:56,370
where clearly the code is not complete
it's not going to succeed at both these

73
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,799
it will answer this first one correctly
but is not going to respond the way our

74
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,400
doctor suggests it should

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,620
her doc string suggests should and Doc

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,650
tests job is to go through pluck out

77
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,420
those examples in doc strings and let
you know when they fail

78
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,870
so this is just a verification technique
for your doc strings

79
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,180
doc strings gets kinda bad rap from
testing snobs because they feel like

80
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,780
it's not a

81
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,910
good complete rigorous unit testing
solution and

82
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,870
fine gonna concede that this is
orthogonal to your unit testing solution

83
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,979
not competing with knows our product
tester anything else

84
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:36,639
instead I'm renaming these to execute a
boat dock strings now the word test

85
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,810
isn't even in their

86
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,590
and the whole point is simply to make
your doc strings

87
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,449
relevant and accurate and more
interesting and enjoyable to read

88
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:51,350
Sep those been around forever next
technology up sphinx is more recent

89
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,400
and this is actually part of why the
documentation in the Python world has

90
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,570
improved a ton

91
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,310
because sinks takes a buncha restructure
text documents

92
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,320
and generates a complex but not overly
complex

93
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,070
I I tree documents they can refer to
each other

94
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,729
they include search ability in index
ability really a pleasure to read in a

95
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,190
pleasure to use

96
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,930
stinks in itself isn't exactly what I'm
calling execute with documentation

97
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,840
but there's some really worthwhile
plugins for six extensions rather

98
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,860
for instance the doc test extension does
exactly what the regular doc test module

99
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,470
does

100
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,710
but it does it against your six document
it comes with think so all you have to

101
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,669
do is say that you want it as you
setting up

102
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:36,259
each speaks project and popping into the
directory where

103
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:39,669
alright here's a restructured text
document that uses it

104
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,970
that big truck in the middle layer is
just it looks exactly like

105
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,060
a doc test you might use in a regular
piece of code but its

106
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,250
included in this doc test directive and
one side done that

107
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,080
when I build my spank stock and include
the magic word doc test

108
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,400
the extension is going to run through
their grab their stock guests and run

109
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,759
them

110
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,780
just the same way the doc test module
itself would

111
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,080
and give me a complaint and thus verify
that the user samples I put in my spinks

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,740
document

113
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,410
are in fact still up to date

114
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,000
6 also has an auto dock extension which
will go through the doc strings in your

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,970
code

116
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,020
pull them into your specs document and

117
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,410
the Sphinx doc test extension
understands what the eye doc extension

118
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,139
is doing

119
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,039
will see those doc tests that have been
brought in that way we recognize the man

120
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,199
execute them so

121
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,360
there'll be another chance to execute
their stock tests and verified it is

122
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,740
working

123
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,139
another possibility this one is not
included with thinks it's called

124
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,419
auto run CF to go through a few steps
first to install it and then to enable

125
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:43,100
it with each

126
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,970
within each thinks project but the idea
is that once you've done so you can

127
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,330
create these

128
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,139
run block directives and then have a
literal block that with this looks a lot

129
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,389
like a doc test

130
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,349
but what is missing is the response
instead of predicting what the response

131
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:01,099
should be and complaining if it's

132
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:06,099
Ron this leaves the response blank and
let that get filled in at the time that

133
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,120
we build the doc

134
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,940
so here we have were using the package
but were you saying nothing about

135
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,210
the response when we make this document
what we get

136
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,349
now the response is that the program
provided are mixed in there into the

137
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:23,130
document

138
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,310
there's one option another extension
very very similar

139
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,460
oh I'm sorry it was we have a little
more to show not a run the other

140
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,560
interesting thing

141
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,580
here I just whipped up a package that
can probe this system find out what the

142
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,870
requirements i txt for

143
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,580
are whether the system meets those
requirements

144
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,800
and then I can invoke that from within
my document

145
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,490
so here's a camera live requirements
document I can also go all the way

146
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,419
outside of pipe on all the way out to
the console with this

147
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:56,160
run block console command and execute a
command line

148
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,120
like I'm going to ask what progress
Russian I'm running

149
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,000
same echo presenter Chamique am

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,110
so the result of that

151
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,210
here we have we checked on our what
documentation we've got

152
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:17,210
an on what push Chris version running

153
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,229
are right another very similar extension
is called program output

154
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:25,690
again you need to you install this
enable it

155
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,889
and the basic working is really really
similar I'm

156
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:32,120
but in this case you have a couple
choices you can either use program

157
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,149
output Corp command output I

158
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,469
you can't go directly into Python if you
want to call Python from here you have

159
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,380
to do is if your attic man mein

160
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,019
using the Python man

161
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:48,230
but let's take it a look at the result
that gives pretty similar the difference

162
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,060
is with the program output

163
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,100
you don't actually see the command it
was used to generate it

164
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,760
whereas with command output the command
that we issued gets echoed back

165
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,339
discover options

166
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,959
tons and advantages to spanks I'm it
generates this lovely structure it's

167
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,410
really become the Python standard

168
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,240
you can host speaks documents well
they're actually playing a shemale so

169
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,470
the really easy to host

170
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,649
but you can also host them at read the
docs for free

171
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:18,750
and then this weeks eco-system is huge
very rich

172
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,870
all search bags all sorts of extensions
and options and yet it's not too hard to

173
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,640
get started with

174
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,970
just right off the bat give shout outs a
couple projects that I don't really have

175
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,390
time to cover in their little bit

176
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,769
off the beaten track but one is called
literate resting

177
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:36,760
is really pretty similar to what I was
showing with the Sphinx extensions

178
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,190
in that it takes to restructure tech
stock and let you go out n

179
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,649
insert external code I'm against one
researcher tech stock at a time it

180
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,250
doesn't look straight into sphinx

181
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,190
that's not a Python program but aides
Brown did it so it deserves and

182
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,399
honorable mention anywhere

183
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,779
and then spinks country auto program is
very limited but nice program that just

184
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:56,320
goes out

185
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,649
if you use Arg purse it looks at your
programs our purse

186
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,709
and pulls that documentation in this pic
so that kinda counts is a version NIV

187
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:06,850
execute all documentation

188
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,170
next big technology is there anybody
here who isn't yet

189
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,149
gathering with excitement over the iPad
a notebook anybody

190
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,170
good good are as well you should be I am

191
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,459
I am NOT going to try to compete with
the fantastic keynote by Fernando

192
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:24,529
yesterday if you haven't seen it
definitely watch the video

193
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:28,899
I am just going to remind you there
every I Python notebook

194
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,920
is in fact a beautiful example %uh
execute herbal documentation as i've

195
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,990
been talking about

196
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,089
because every single cell in that
notebook can either be a markdown cell

197
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:41,570
which will be interpreted into a good
looking piece a document

198
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,959
or a code cell which you can execute

199
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,810
and get the results right there and of
course because it's I Python

200
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,870
you're not limited to Python you can use
the

201
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,360
exclamation point and go outside the
system so this is doing

202
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,089
what this week six engines were doing
doing it really fast and easy when it

203
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:00,480
comes to ease

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,890
integrating the documentation part with
the code part you

205
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,230
you really can't beat this every single
cell I'm

206
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,680
are you do you say oh okay this one
occurred sell this one to market and

207
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,089
sell

208
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,300
and that's all there is to it

209
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:20,230
you our image change that's right mine

210
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,980
I price I know but you have a bunch I
have options for serving them you can

211
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,570
certainly certainly yourselves

212
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,589
NB viewer is supplied by the iPad time
project

213
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,850
basically if your notebook is save out
there on the web

214
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,260
anywhere and has a URL then you pump
that URL

215
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,320
over to NB viewer and Nazif

216
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,570
and then is hosted on line this is a
free service now in this case

217
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,260
its a static copy of the document to the
user can actually use it live

218
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,510
but they can always download and then
run it on their own machine if they like

219
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,600
and then I'm continue analytics will let
you host a notebook live

220
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,660
at work carried out I L again for free
at least for certain

221
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,709
Nasher at the cutoff is or how they're
running works but on

222
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,680
so you have all these options for
hosting in the iPod iPhone nobody's

223
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,110
going to the most executed documentation
because not

224
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,750
only do you get to execute it when you
generate the document

225
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,800
the user can execute it well they're
reading it and see what actually to run

226
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,660
their system

227
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,950
in fact they can jump in an experiment
with these code tells

228
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,730
try things out so that they you can be
introducing a concept to them

229
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,570
in the documentation part and their work
area to try it out an experiment and

230
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,240
learn things

231
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,019
is right there in the very same window
their brain doesn't have to switch gears

232
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,750
as the move back and forth between other
windows

233
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,250
amazing amazing 20

234
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,399
now the notebook that i've shown really
basic

235
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,820
really dull but the iPad from project
has some

236
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,779
amazing tools out there look at the main
in the viewer site

237
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,800
which hosts some great-looking notebooks

238
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,230
the there's a galleria interesting I
Python notebooks likewise

239
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,430
really expand your brain with some other
possibilities I'm just gonna quickly

240
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,480
show you

241
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,560
one notebook that was used to generate a
text book abusive educational material

242
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,360
so if you want to know if a miss crusher

243
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,440
the sizable if the notebook can

244
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,250
do the sort rich output that you need
for what you're looking for

245
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,760
on the answers almost certainly s

246
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:25,760
so not only does it have all this the
user can go and mess with things

247
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,350
I'm yeah really easy integration between
the code in the document

248
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,269
he's a guest to experiment and all these
hosting options definitely want

249
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:38,149
check out the iPad and MacBook

250
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,990
last technology I think i'm brushing
from their nervousness is

251
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,959
forgive me I'm Dec see here's the only
one you probably haven't heard on at a

252
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:46,589
guess

253
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,959
this is a framework for applying various
transformations to documents that

254
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,870
sounds kinda meaningless but will get it
installed

255
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,250
and then we'll try their several steps
to using it

256
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,579
first you need to run setup to build can
be

257
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:07,079
infrastructure that you need in the
directory

258
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,139
then you right up your source text files
these can be there restructure text or

259
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,529
markdown

260
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:16,320
then you need to write a recipe and
that's just a text file that tells Dec

261
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,670
see

262
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,860
what transformations you want to apply

263
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,990
finally year ended exit command itself
to

264
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,120
generate the document from all this
source

265
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,449
cell here's an example of a source file
that's going to run through Dec see

266
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:37,290
it looks pretty similar to that what
we've seen before but now

267
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,810
who I wish hang on can I crank that
France as a now it's

268
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,160
rather resists having the size cranked
up sorry about that

269
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,420
I'm

270
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,180
what we had here this looks like a
ginger to tag in fact

271
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,279
is agenda to tag and it says we want to
go out to taxi

272
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,839
and have it grab a document and include
that in here

273
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,149
and then pipe that through its own
intent filter index EE to the

274
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:04,829
transformation to refer to as filters

275
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:08,990
so basically we want the right exit this
script and then we watch it again but

276
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,880
this time

277
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,959
we're grabbing the Texas the script and
they were popping it through the

278
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,800
pipeline filter in other words

279
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,230
run it through Python and get the
results include that right here

280
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,410
and then we're going to do something
similar on the software requirements

281
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,670
finally we're going to go out n use a
bash script

282
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,040
and pump there is also that bash her
sorry pump this bash script

283
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,240
through bash itself to executed and
we're going to insert

284
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,290
those results right here in the
paragraph and Dec see is the only tool

285
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,889
that makes it easy to

286
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:45,269
insert your results wherever you want
them in the document they don't need to

287
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,740
be in

288
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,300
separate blocks they can be right there
in the flood the text if that's what you

289
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,769
want

290
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:54,480
so let's see the result I'm sorry I
forgot

291
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,540
the recipe file the next thing you have
to do is say to Texas alright

292
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,320
for although the restructured text file
defined in this directory

293
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,339
please apply ginger so that the tags be
work

294
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,990
and then there's a couple on filters
that basically set up some sane defaults

295
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,750
for an HTML page

296
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,620
and then these intended items does
represent requirements

297
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,680
there required for the IRS e-file namely
you're going to need to pump

298
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,529
I the Python files through the pipe and
filter and bash house had through the

299
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:25,290
bash filter

300
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,680
so finally once we've done at my
goodness

301
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,240
her Hatton not a problem I have thought
I had that going let

302
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,079
an ass which winners this

303
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:47,079
haha

304
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,420
I know ok that's right a big burn

305
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,140
remember would have to you thank ru
doing great here

306
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,790
they're bigger alright here's our result

307
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,770
so we have the techs %uh the Python
program and then we have

308
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:09,530
the result and Python program here we
didn't ask for the tax if it we just ask

309
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,199
for the result

310
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,030
and here we have requires Bob apply you
have

311
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,750
PostgreSQL and this is the result that
bash script

312
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:24,750
inserted directly into my paragraph
money back up a place

313
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,990
art

314
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,750
advantages and exceed you get a huge
variety of transformations in fact

315
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,760
I meant to put this in stride but let's
arm I mention that

316
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,370
each of these transformations is called
a filter index E

317
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,640
so Dec see has a

318
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,650
lot I love available filters

319
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,920
how can as I get your as almost too many

320
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,220
I'm and XE others written in Python

321
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,750
the code your executing doesn't have to
be in Python so if you're doing a ruby

322
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,670
or copy scripter who knows what

323
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,150
you can type it through any of those as
the filter and document up

324
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,720
whatever language you're working in and
you have really

325
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,480
the most complete control of the output
see if you have really exacting demands

326
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,240
and what the output is gonna look like

327
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,510
you very well may need to have end up
using taxi

328
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,210
but I gotta admit this is the hardest
one to work with

329
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,830
on I was up kinda late last night caused
XE was doing some last-minute betrayal

330
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,260
on me

331
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,440
I'm to you can put more work into this
if that's the way you need to go

332
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,260
I'm there's a dixie reset commit command
that you will probably need to fall back

333
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,720
on sometimes because

334
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,900
Dixie caches and either there's a bug or
I'm bad at using it and it keeps on

335
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,510
thinking that issue reuse cashed
material that I have refreshed also

336
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,950
here's the irony: the documentation for
Dixie is incomplete

337
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,920
white okay wherever I'm nonetheless an
extremely powerful 20

338
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,020
so I'm shown you mechanics

339
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,570
mechanics a really basic hello world
style wrapping Cody into documentation

340
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,040
honestly that was not the most important
part in the talk

341
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,179
this is the most important part the talk
which is where you use your imagination

342
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:17,100
to apply these techniques to you all
sorts of problems also to documents that

343
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,750
you write

344
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,030
almost anything that you write this on
the computer could benefit

345
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,100
if you think about imaginatively for
example

346
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,240
don't just assert white on Python
versions your code runs with

347
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,630
run talks include the results ever talks
run

348
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,820
right there in the document how about
living lecture notes where the student

349
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,830
can experiment

350
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,850
as the read without even breaking away
from your text that would be an iPad for

351
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,480
notebook

352
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,070
technique in intact I've used that to
teach it does work very well

353
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,070
how about tutorials actually

354
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,620
assist with configuration obviously they
would need to install

355
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,900
your document first but then the
tutorial could

356
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,670
look at the system see what they have in
help talkin to what else they need

357
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,830
or a troubleshooting document that
doesn't just say what the problem might

358
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,429
be

359
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:07,250
but the examines the system tries to
figure out what the problem might be

360
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,429
don't just say this needs to gigs memory
say

361
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,040
this needs to gigs memory and I see that
you only have one gig

362
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,679
maybe that's the problem how about
dashboards

363
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,130
that don't just give you statistics and
facts about the system

364
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,320
but included text explaining the
relevance and those statistics and those

365
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,070
facts

366
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,910
how about organizational documentation
that response to changes in the

367
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,770
organization

368
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,940
so it no longer says see joe for a new
laptop

369
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,679
once joe's user account disappears from
the system how about

370
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,700
compliance documentation for those if
you have to do PCI compliance

371
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,130
documentation or government compliance
documentation

372
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,500
the actually can verify itself don't
just

373
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,070
assert that the data is hashed in the
database for example

374
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,450
you can query the database in the
document and verify that

375
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,990
tons of possibilities I hope that your
imagination will get fired up

376
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,010
that you will start to include these
techniques in document to rate in the

377
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,330
future

378
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,130
and I hope that your imagination will
work on some questions

379
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,750
I'm they get have ripple is right here

380
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,730
and all the slides are rate here plus of
course you will be able to find them

381
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,110
on the Python web site I finished way
early so if you don't have some

382
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,850
questions are gonna have a long break

383
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:30,850
thank you

384
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,539
hi I grow talk

385
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:40,029
I was wondering so I'm running a saucer
where we have going to the conditions

386
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:40,799
tutorial

387
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,559
I love how to install the software and
the steps the

388
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,009
also create for the congressional Sloan
Anza

389
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:52,039
on maybe I'm missing something I was
wondering if we could run

390
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,129
this story all the games like like a
test it was a solution for that for

391
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:57,209
creating files

392
00:21:57,209 --> 00:22:01,269
and changing those two lines and so on
on

393
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:04,329
yes I do think that you should be able
to do that if you can

394
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:08,219
the trouble is of course that the user
is first going to need to get

395
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:11,669
enough installed so that one of these
techniques will work

396
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:14,919
on so that they will need to have a
little bit

397
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,309
have I though even need to have been
notebook or whatever the technology is

398
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:22,959
but at that point you could definitely
have on a document that

399
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:26,749
then oh no I was wondering there was a
way to make sure that the strip but this

400
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:27,969
tutorial is still valid

401
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:31,889
like we don't have to David Stewart like
if every time we do a comment on our

402
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:32,889
software

403
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:36,529
rear-ended the that with this tutorial
against the softer

404
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:42,039
I C yes well if it for instance if it's
thinks then every time you run make HTML

405
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:46,690
I it's going to execute those the if
you're using like the iran or program

406
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,159
output

407
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,579
that will in fact execute every time you

408
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:54,070
run make HTML see if you can run a make
a bit

409
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,769
wherever that fits into your workflow
generating the document it will

410
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:01,649
confirm that live distinct exactly and
when I was wondering if

411
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:07,139
if there was a tool for because here
like they are great tools for doctors

412
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:09,359
stand for Python testing but what about

413
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,669
unabashed testing modify missile I think
this file

414
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:16,759
and I'm good so for example there is a

415
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,499
the choice asking trade this followed
this

416
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:24,469
exact path yes is there such school arm

417
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:29,269
if you're let me think you can

418
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:34,059
right up to say if you wrote up a bash
script that would look at the system to

419
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:34,919
see if they'd

420
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:39,989
followed this tutorial steps arm then
you could include the result from that

421
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:43,589
in a document and many I'm a close to
what you're getting at I'm not sure

422
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,249
I am not really a I think we can chat
about

423
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:52,009
yet to 800 I'm sorry I'm mad at me I'm
missing the point okay that's right 36

424
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:53,469
will have a catch you after

425
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:58,190
I'm say I guess I actually have a very
similar question so

426
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,079
we shouldn't write documentation that is
Taz but it for putting code in our

427
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,059
documentation

428
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,190
ih0 can any of these tools

429
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,489
test the expected result I mean if we
put a doc test but if we say

430
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:14,309
you know I don't want my documentation
is a not implemented or value error:

431
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:15,299
something

432
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:19,469
in that case arm the doc test

433
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:22,629
extension 26 would be a good one in that
it doesn't

434
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:27,359
throw ugly things into the document it
just verifies that what you have

435
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,450
is what you expected on so that might be
the way you want to go in a case

436
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,719
this probably way too I'm sure you could
hack up the other techniques like

437
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:38,429
the notebook to do that to you but yet
the doctor succession would be

438
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:41,509
the easiest way to approach that just
quick answer also this

439
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:45,269
if anybody knows about seaborn plotting
library

440
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:48,679
on top of met put leap for a partner
boobs

441
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,799
so that gay road little script which
tested notebook produces the same

442
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:58,079
output as before writes a few great
document tonight but nobody just

443
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,179
rerun it and it would with verify the
doubt but is the same so it's simple

444
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:02,999
solution for that

445
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:08,279
big and isn't that in 0 cash there's a
repository over I Python notebook

446
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,639
add-ons is that do you know if that's
where that is

447
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:14,979
I just saw it in seaborne itself so if
you go to Kop

448
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:19,849
on just search for a seaborne and its
beautiful plotting library gay so

449
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:23,529
based on panda so if you want really
quick overview

450
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:26,669
Andries tutorials on that and how he
analyzed

451
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:31,200
Titanic data using seaborn just really
going step by step

452
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,989
ok but that's all we had a virgin so
sent pete has the tool seaborn for

453
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:39,219
verifying that an iPad and notebook is
not giving you weird unexpected results

454
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:42,859
okay thank you for that I'm the question
use

455
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:48,190
doxie as a preprocessor spanks basically
keep the output has restructured test

456
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,049
and unprofor that means for example you
can in fact do that

457
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:56,210
arm and that would be one way to still
use stinks

458
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,859
and grab some additional options for how
to incorporate live data for your system

459
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:03,399
via the Dexia excellent example yeah yet
because you re

460
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:07,849
your output format from Dec see doesn't
have to be

461
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:11,359
anything a couldn't you can just put it
right back into restructure text

462
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,419
and the process that from there thank
you for a great example

463
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:19,440
I'm so like you said we've all seen eye
Python notebook do you like insanely

464
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,079
mind-blowingly awesome things

465
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,659
om has anyone tried to integrate that
into staying so that you can get all

466
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:27,019
those cool like

467
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:31,419
a spinny charts in like sliders that
make we graphed things are

468
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:34,589
I mean so that probably wouldn't be
possible in stock it static environment

469
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:35,460
but like

470
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,960
has anyone tried to get to like I guess
get to know that I Python magic into

471
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,229
sphinx yes

472
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:44,299
I'm usually the answer to you has anyone
tried is yes

473
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:48,499
okay I am but I don't know okay I'm
gonna throw this one out I don't know

474
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:51,109
such example does anyone know hun

475
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,929
does anyone is a much safer sprints I

476
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:58,619
I'm that would be a really interesting
project and I can't tell you

477
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:02,950
but get thank you thank you

478
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,029
okay I'm one other

479
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,549
interesting tool to look at here is and
another things plugin called Manuel

480
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:13,569
Maj lets you and instead o

481
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:17,409
displaying your your talk tests as

482
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:20,569
doc tests allows you to show them as
code snippets which the

483
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:23,599
more complex examples can be I'm

484
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,309
really helpful and well as in

485
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:30,690
the waiter from and

486
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,759
both towers I mene you

487
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,259
empl yes whom

488
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:40,629
I had to put high PI in there as well to
get

489
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:44,539
fundamentally okay well thank you for
the recommendation to the center is

490
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,889
somewhere out there is thinks Manuel
extension

491
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:53,509
that well I'm give you other options for
running the doc tests

492
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:58,269
an OK celibacy my contacts or give me
trouble under the glare I think that's

493
00:27:58,269 --> 00:27:59,999
all the questions we have a right

494
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:06,999
okay alright thank you

495
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:08,239
enjoyed a recipe I got
