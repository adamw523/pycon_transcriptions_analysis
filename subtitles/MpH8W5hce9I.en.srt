1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,629
okay

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,160
good afternoon hike on hope you enjoyed
your luncheon at the poster session

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,469
there

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,480
and the job fair I am just a couple
announcements before we get started here

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,580
and I just like to remind all the
auction winners to pick up their

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,199
winnings

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,180
if you want an item the auction last
night please go down to the registration

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,859
desk

9
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:30,310
right now to pick it up they'll be
closing soon and secondly

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,680
I like to mention the sprints after the
conference and it will be holding

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,030
developments prints

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,890
Spencer great chance to get your first
patch accepted to you favor library

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,129
and meet the authors and get introduced
to open source contribution

14
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:45,530
so stick around after the closing
messages for an introduction to the

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,270
sprints

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,960
or just show up here on Monday and if
you want to lead a sprint

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,770
please prepare a two minute description
to get people excited about spending on

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,210
the project

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,920
okay assessed humanism

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,800
okay it is now twenty seconds okay and
to get people excited about spending on

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,430
the project

22
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,560
you have to present that after the
lightning talks okay

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,270
I am so next up we have crater schemes

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,270
and he's gonna be telling us about
PostgreSQL almonds

25
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:21,270
for humans take a two-week break thanks
to everyone

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,400
so I'm cursing I work at hurricane Iran
product for a couple teams for data team

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
a transfer record high stress

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,780
I languages team I am I basically have
the job doing whatever the engineers

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,479
don't want to be a

30
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,079
is where describe it I to really quickly

31
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:44,100
a to sort of sound some quick in Chama
spikes

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,659
and drugs talk it's gonna be a little
bit of a shotgun approach Metro kinda

33
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:48,100
lotta

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,899
but there is information that you on a
lot to get through so it'll kind of be a

35
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:52,659
little bit desperate

36
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,170
at times on for some shameless plugs II
curator I

37
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,229
non-islamic help us first weekly on
eastern end user app developer and his a

38
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:02,180
stress hopefully it has useful content

39
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,540
I I'd like a good bet pass-first guy is
kinda

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,050
a guide for I'm you know getting started
up to you

41
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,560
some and I think all things and
prosperous I if you're on a map

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,290
Mac use post rest ap don't use

43
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,580
back porch a homebrew on a GRT got it
great keep using it but I if you run

44
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,520
into problems with it which you well

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,620
I get past estaba try and then our

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,050
Erica we ran a lot of stress so I

47
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,410
usually when I i cant quite he talks and

48
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,200
usually when I talk about you know high
stress on my screen I put up a slide

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,530
I that looks kinda like this on this is
all the awesome features and pasta

50
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,450
recipe don't know about something aside

51
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,489
google it every single thing here he's
probably know about news

52
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,560
I'll have the ability to use it sometime
arm

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,580
to make this easy for for Twitter I

54
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,900
this is a quote by a coworker and
basically post press is becoming more

55
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,379
and more

56
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,569
data platform that is just a relational
database on this full text search there

57
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:03,430
she is.

58
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,760
and there's about everything you could
want to do in there I

59
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,700
and it's really becoming a much more
flexible haha wrong so kinda getting in

60
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,650
till a bit more

61
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,110
that the meat I'll when you think about
database workloads are sketchy wasters

62
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,280
I allow penalty p IOM

63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,159
cell ltp is essentially webapps om

64
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,409
that's you know web application Shango
flask I

65
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:31,459
small writes and reads transactional
workloads I am

66
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,950
allowed is business reporting be I
larger ports over a lot of data

67
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,220
on you're looking at I am pp type
solutions here

68
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,849
and I essentially not gonna talk about
any %uh this really in the talk

69
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,200
I'm so sure looking at this I you need
to get kinda

70
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,379
advice I'm and warehousing stuff have
been shot afterwards

71
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:54,450
but hopefully most the people in this
room are by that developers

72
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,900
my sister has said the case for most
people developing webapps

73
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,049
okay costs alright I can't thank God

74
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:07,000
I am on set up and configure I'm not
gonna spend a whole lot I'm here since

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,239
you only have to do it once

76
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,569
other shorter than is a John

77
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:16,709
Amazon I use her ok Ill Oregon check out
this talk last year I think from

78
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,570
icon on said mining and analyzing a cop
it is pasta ski on its not your day job

79
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,400
by Christoph Hess it's a great talk
basically there's about 30 convicts you

80
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,389
need to set up once

81
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,949
what you do it you're done I am so I
start there

82
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,169
and essentially don't worry about it on
because Amazon

83
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:38,630
it's short of virtualized infrastructure
atop a virtualized infrastructure on top

84
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,210
shelf

85
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,430
more virtualization on it a little
different

86
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,610
if you're on any other cloud I'm a lot
of them are a good bit different you get

87
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,900
a little more predictability and

88
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,690
and disconnect anything I'm the best bet
is to stress going to get a job

89
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,800
so you're saying how much you can take
their I'm a little different

90
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,199
I'll basically you up and running and if
you're on real hardware

91
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,410
I high-performance PostgreSQL despite a
little

92
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,190
all now is based on as Chris 9.0 on but
if you guy

93
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,680
SSD's fusion-io I'm really kinda any
real hardware

94
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,919
at this is still really applicable i
think is being upgraded for updated for

95
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,120
9.3

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,210
but I essentially this is aryanna Starr

97
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,360
on and they're going to the slides as
well

98
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,150
so I anytime I i coming weekend i'm new
database

99
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,389
a first thing I do is like take the
thirty thousand but you have

100
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,960
how's this doing on there's any more
hardware

101
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,120
is it just screwed on how how that are
we doing

102
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,310
I and the number one thing that anywhere
that care about

103
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,590
is that the cash so post-crescent really
good at keeping frequently accessed data

104
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,660
in memory

105
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,509
I I know you think any better at
catching your data and has Creswell

106
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:58,490
you want on go ahead and try it's really
getting this

107
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,080
I'm so all essentially a name for a
pretty high like 99 percent cash ratio

108
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,169
administering de nada memory

109
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,539
99 percent at a time one person
attending desk arm

110
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:12,110
to get that year and the super simple
query

111
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,370
and its gonna give you something that
looks like this I am

112
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,720
basically don't cry try to memorize the
clear you figure out what it's doing its

113
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,539
crazy and help us press stuff some the
columns actually don't make sense

114
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,770
combats gonna give you know the cache
hit ratio

115
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,530
on and like I said 99 percent or higher
is what you're aiming for

116
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,720
on if you don't have that you probably
wanna throw more memory in the box

117
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,100
on that's the easiest way to search
going to database

118
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,770
so index hit is another one and how
often are using indexes for not so

119
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,350
this is definitely important for web
applications if you're talking about be

120
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,220
I

121
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,590
and reporting applications it's less
common I

122
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,590
but what I wanna see is you know heavy
index usage on thing sir

123
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,169
trend X on frequently

124
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:02,910
so that crazy me something like this and
from here I can actually start digging

125
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,229
in and saying

126
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:07,750
I where we're going to add in Texas

127
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,900
and %uh some rough guidelines so cache
hit ratio

128
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,259
I'm 99 percent or higher as soon as you
drop below 90

129
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:19,020
9 percent don't like 95 you're gonna see
performance significantly tank

130
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,720
and ex-head ratio a greater than 95
percent

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,960
I actually have a tweet somewhere in my
history that aladdin and exxon every

132
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,560
column and every table in your database

133
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,060
I'll an encourager be could definitely
do it on

134
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,470
if you're using a table that said I've
got a table and backers again said there

135
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,780
never using index

136
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,590
I start acting like it should be pretty
straight forward on higher using the

137
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,660
table

138
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,210
I if it's really small table and you can
get away without it

139
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,520
so I love really handy shortcut how he
will hear use like a pasar see here

140
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,270
MRC how the people here use a PC carsey

141
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,190
I'm actually impressed that theres like
10 hands in the room I'm so peace Eagle

142
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,270
RC is awesome

143
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,669
it does and it's the same thing right
and you can set a lotta commands

144
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,349
at the really nice thing is that you
cannot set in short cuts here so I can

145
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:09,599
name Clarisse

146
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,599
so I can have that cash head query saved
and just ran cacheid

147
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,419
on any database I can act on its gonna
run a query for me answer really handy

148
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:23,039
for free call use queries across
different systems are working with

149
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,340
so a better a quick detour on how data
is retrieved

150
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,120
I'm hopefully this is really boring and
101 by if it's not

151
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,519
I think it's a good baseline for every
one and a half

152
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,800
so on when iraq in your database in your
training data from it

153
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,620
really basically attack on come down to
consume data want to waste

154
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,430
on a sequential scans all the data
simply sitting on desk

155
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,070
and if you have a query select star
where this condition is true it's gonna

156
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,740
start generating on desk

157
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,870
on and looking for data that meets at
condition

158
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,490
and the only way it's gonna stop on
scanning that he was why it's

159
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,860
you got a lot on so she got a limit of
one its gonna find the first row

160
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,120
and tell me second ish an reading desk
is obviously slow

161
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,290
are in contrast is an index right so

162
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,390
here to add really done down version a
b-tree index

163
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,930
whereas can now based on this initial
value I'm gonna go to you

164
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,480
but the setting records anarchy
traversing down to have this record

165
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,670
on indexes House press nine to four
always had to help desk

166
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,140
so post retire the covers is a really
giant and only lock

167
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,089
I just keeps writing data writing their
writing do you know when you to lead a

168
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,649
date actually writes data

169
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:39,570
so N and exit in memory may not know the
date has been removed

170
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,300
so it always has had escalating index
and post crest

171
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,230
by +91 up and there's something an index
only scant that

172
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,339
if he can use it it's great it's kind of
magic white doesn't doesn't

173
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:56,709
I am there's not created by Shirley tell
a shooting when it should be using wired

174
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,910
doesn't buy it must that I can use it
well

175
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,990
I know that's not super helpful but here
on ninety nine three get some

176
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,209
performance gains there

177
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:09,700
so roth somewhere sequential scans okay
they're not always bad they're good for

178
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,019
like report any better

179
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,700
carry-over atomic data on

180
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,149
and expands web applications this is
where you should mostly see

181
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,570
I index can't be in use on its famous
coming quarters in your app

182
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,010
isolation expect

183
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,540
so how do you understand specific query
performance

184
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,320
and given a really basic wary I what we
can do is put in explaining from it

185
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,500
on post dress for every query its Ryan
has a

186
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,490
a query plan and putting a smile show
you what the query planes going to be

187
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,800
and how long it thinks it's going to
take I mean you're gonna get this

188
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,890
kinda cryptic output the Super Street
Ford and anyone the first time a look at

189
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,950
it

190
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,760
I it's really not too bad so there's
three values right there

191
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,490
on the startup time which is how long it
takes to start that process

192
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,660
I'm the max I'm it thinks it's going to
take and how many roses thinks it's

193
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,209
going to return

194
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:09,459
on running explain analyze

195
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,920
you're going to get what it thinks it's
going to do which is great out there

196
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,130
about any actual time

197
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,709
and so want the real thing you wanna
look at there is that Max hyman each

198
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:18,649
step

199
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:22,079
a whereas taking it on a time

200
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,850
dumbing ahead have a rough guidelines I
love queries and web applications

201
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,120
on aiming for pagers hi simon Le Santana
Moss I guess kinda nice

202
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,680
are coming for you should be in less
than 10 milliseconds I really am for

203
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,089
round one I can always get below one
millisecond

204
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,149
I can usually get to I have

205
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:43,310
wine .5 Chennai seconds pretty
consistently on any

206
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,640
for a run I mean more rare queries less
happened in a sec

207
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,350
to coming back here on it you gotta pay
that's slow

208
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,220
I you can basically run me explain on to
explain allies

209
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,529
I would actually executes the query as
well and see how long it takes

210
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,800
and say okay this is crap let's a

211
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,760
let's start optimizing on basically
pretty straight forward I had

212
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,149
filter on salary understand that an
index on salary

213
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,149
I wanna see this hot from using a
scandal scandal Return Index can now

214
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:23,000
and Mike Hightower expect

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,149
so this is great if I have us at page
that I want optimizing queries

216
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:30,980
I'm some people start there but for a
lot of people it's like

217
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,740
hey how do I look at my database an
aggregate say I wanted to start

218
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,389
optimizing queries at Pt stats cement is
probably the least

219
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:42,720
are most underused physically told
directly and prosperous

220
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,740
so what it doesn't is normalized every
single query

221
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,490
against your database to where I got you
know I Cox question right there

222
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,700
on its like Iran and at that with were
in a legal strike in iraq and I just

223
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,480
walked out I get her a few

224
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,940
on for that parameter and when this is
gonna do

225
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,529
I'll when you turn on your database by
just running for an extension piece

226
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,440
estimate

227
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,870
Harcourt every single Korean its rhyme
I'm the average time it takes

228
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:13,440
and how many times it's run I'm so I can
run something like this now

229
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,959
which will give me the total number of
time a craze been running into some the

230
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,060
average number time

231
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,310
and the query itself

232
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,510
so from here I can say what are the most
expensive queries in aggregate on my

233
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,750
system and won't work I optimize

234
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,070
so coming back to this knowing I can get
to it and he's probably down to 10

235
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,060
seconds

236
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,139
I can say I i cant get two orders of
magnitude back on a second one and get a

237
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:40,279
lot of time back to my system pretty
spread quickly

238
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:44,570
so our index is high-stress has quite a
few

239
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,850
on if you're like me I when you when you
read the docs

240
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,769
the general reaction is this

241
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,019
on the docks to help out on and explain
kinda what they are under the covers but

242
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,610
not when you use them

243
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,240
I really done down versions b-tree when
you say create index

244
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,209
this is what you get this is usually
what you want usually don't have to

245
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,370
think too much about it

246
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,589
on if you're doing anything interesting
I like pushy I asked for full text

247
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:11,209
search

248
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:15,500
or something more unique data types like
hora you may want to resellers

249
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,440
so I generalize inverted index as I
Genentech's

250
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,550
I wrought on it he got multiple values
in a single column this is what you want

251
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,570
so its shore I had eventually J sign

252
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,000
I a race out of time to put this on
their

253
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,110
and some cases just to be a little
better but I wouldn't worry too much

254
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,010
about it

255
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,720
I jest ruffle a tom is full text search
for shapes

256
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,420
so if you're doing GIS stuff I'm going
to be using a lot I just

257
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,209
Nexus aspin three others

258
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,290
I can and as for similarity

259
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,870
SPGs I've had this explain to me about
50 times by a lot of us press people

260
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:01,370
on it all I know is is good for phone
numbers so

261
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,010
I yeah on if you have a straightforward
explanation I would love to hear

262
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,649
I'm vodka on cell

263
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:14,050
almost all these index has come out as a
group led the Huskers community i

264
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,920
I'm here for stress the russians I am
their job at a professor's over and

265
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,760
University of moscow want a professor
astrophysics and attacks on house place

266
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,790
for fun

267
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,310
on the come up with crazy ideas for
indexes and optimizations

268
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,269
and I but I believe is one that
up-and-coming

269
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:34,690
it's a space partition Chen and X I

270
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,199
and because they're Russian they they
thought we had Jan and we needed by K

271
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:39,930
and their

272
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,959
this is the working name I hope it
doesn't make it in this this I don't

273
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:43,350
know

274
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,240
when that battle I

275
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,120
yeah so morning Texas I'll spit and he's
pretty quickly on you also have a

276
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,250
condition on factual a nexus

277
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,209
on conditional hopefully is pretty
straightforward I'm selecting star from

278
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:58,279
places

279
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,930
on and I say I only want big cities rain
and maybe that's a a common thing in my

280
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,589
application

281
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,690
a good example is this is where current
address is true rate if you got history

282
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,610
where everyone's leading the only care
about the recent one mostly

283
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,009
on UK index on that and pretty
straightforward seniors can add the

284
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:16,370
condition on the index

285
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,949
just like you would in a query I'm so he
got out on a date at the only 1i index

286
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:21,509
of it

287
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:27,759
for I efficiency I have news for teasing

288
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,180
also functional in Texas so you can
index on a function

289
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,269
I'm so in this case I got sunday sunday
to

290
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:39,190
I am daytime a stress is marginally
useful right now

291
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,670
on yet to write about two functions to
make it useful

292
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,029
I'm but I can basically say give me this
at

293
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:50,040
key back population and i wanna find her
populations greater than

294
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,959
10,000 so I can actually add an index on
that function so I

295
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,649
any function impulse Press any
user-defined function you can and exxon

296
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:03,949
I am one important thing about
functional in Texas

297
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:08,929
and hopefully a sound a little weird
counter-intuitive candidate in the first

298
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:13,370
if the same and putting the function
returns the same output

299
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,270
I you want to meet up on it so basically
if you have random things happening in

300
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,160
the function

301
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,689
are you wanna meet upon and post-test
rhesus differently and knows that has

302
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:24,390
always been a return the same result
given the same input

303
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:30,260
and does very very different things for
her performance

304
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,890
ISO condition on functional I hopefully
no surprise here you can combine DC

305
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:41,470
can say in how the output in this
function is created in some time

306
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,059
to another thing a create index
concurrently if you're running any

307
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:45,809
production

308
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,270
%uh system this is probably what you
wanna be using I'm here and create

309
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,710
indexes gonna hold the lock on a table
of rewriting that index

310
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,390
i'm concerned. other databases this is
the only choice you have

311
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,789
I post-crescent least gives you another
option where create indexing currently

312
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:01,820
is going to build this index up in the
background

313
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,620
I'll I say there's a whole lot that's
only half true at all to lock for

314
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,520
a couple of milliseconds so for a couple
of milliseconds you can write here David

315
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,070
database I but it's pretty trivial

316
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,160
I it's gonna be slower by it's just not
working

317
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,320
factory now production on everyone's
happier

318
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,860
I'm is anyone here using a store and
past press

319
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,080
okay thing on hazing Jason

320
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,910
okay a few hands I am eight stores are
some people should use it if you're

321
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,030
unfamiliar with it

322
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,890
are here have a quick run through after
eight stories a key-value store inside

323
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,799
your database

324
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,450
outside just another datatype I you
enable it by running for an extension a

325
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,530
store

326
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,549
and then you have this a store data type
down here

327
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:51,789
on I usually get some flack for congress
data but I think it's fair catch train

328
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:54,240
and AM turning in there is a keen eye
store

329
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,350
an be can do things like this

330
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,570
psych answered you know I genders male
status California here

331
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,880
I can answer all sorts in your keys I
can die

332
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,480
search filter on those just like you
expect I'm just like any other key to

333
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,700
the store

334
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,210
I J sin God and suppose kress and

335
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,260
9 who I believe and 93 it became a
little more useful

336
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,919
I am it's still marginally useful on J
sin is really just

337
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,250
validation on text today and there's no
big optimizations around it just

338
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,490
validates the Texas Dallas

339
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,950
on there are some functions for helping
was searching on it now

340
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,720
that came in 93 I but overall it have a
marginal use

341
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,070
on if you're using EES I eight stores
kinda the way I have go today

342
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,620
I'm index has worked with its own Jan
just index you can just at age in index

343
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,400
at Sky index every key every value I
insider database

344
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,830
there's a talk at fosston this year
research for performance have

345
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,960
I post best first Mongo DB I am

346
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,559
it actually hold up compares pretty well
arm in some cases it's faster

347
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:06,030
some cases lowers in some cases the
grandest and some cases smaller but it's

348
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,429
really comparable overall

349
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:11,360
I it's not a full document star though
which is what a lot of people I

350
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,020
I'm such a sign you know what's that on
it is a for Jason documents are in

351
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,990
Cyprus Press

352
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,320
I but functional indexes are you have to
do to get good performance there unless

353
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,830
you're just showing and i cant pulling
it out

354
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,440
I'm so have fun with that I miss him a
lot of working at performance

355
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,760
I press nine fours around the corner and
Jason be just committed

356
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,220
I'm so Jason B is binary representation
and chase on desk

357
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,289
and that this is actually crowd poration
with a lot of people with Engine Yard

358
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:43,980
Roku PD experts and the russians of
course

359
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,490
and they were involved in something
crazy I

360
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,770
said this is what was aged or two

361
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,030
with Chase on top of it which indexes
work so kinda the best serve all worlds

362
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,490
finely tuned to buttress

363
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:02,740
I believe the plan is just to bina data
type

364
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,409
so our connection pooling on is another
big area

365
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:10,909
on if you're on Django 1.5 or earlier
please tell me you're using a connection

366
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:11,390
polar

367
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,500
I'm Django 1.6 II got persistent
connections and the ability to have a

368
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,070
polar

369
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:21,419
and makes life a lot better on if you're
running a database with SSL you should

370
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,419
expect a connection on Jinger 15

371
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:26,440
to be around thirty to forty seconds I

372
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,440
30 to 40 milliseconds for just getting a
connection you've got maybe you want to

373
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,240
second query

374
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,070
are no sanctuary but you're spending 30
times had actually just getting the

375
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,299
texture database

376
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:41,400
I see clout to me is already pretty good
here on but in short you can I got a

377
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,570
couple options about the application
framework handling this for you

378
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,220
question has gotten a lot better I'm in
recent releases see clock me does as

379
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,130
well

380
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,130
i'm anne also got the nationalist an
on-demand so even with

381
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,059
a connection to learn your framework on
you may

382
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,500
matsu run II server-side application
side

383
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,220
on caterpillar I am post rest as well

384
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,610
up to a hundred China connections and
then after that you need to consider

385
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,770
another option

386
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:14,710
on the POS press Options there's really
two IPD bouncer and petty pol

387
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,750
I won't go into details over might
encourage these at PG bouncer I don't

388
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,510
know that anchors the city for

389
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,840
it takes such as you're doing a whole
lot of things okay

390
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,090
and PD bouncer does one thing really
well which is connectable

391
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,510
are so when it comes to scaling

392
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,429
as I mentioned the easiest way a bus
killing when you need more memory

393
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:39,530
is scale-up I'll but as a certain point
that's not possible for databases

394
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:44,720
IMC can also scale that out on post
dress when you have a replica any such

395
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,850
an increase to it

396
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,220
it to keep that cast completely separate
so it's gonna have all the same data

397
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,780
but its cash much in memory is going to
be different so you can do things like

398
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,549
sending

399
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:59,200
guy you now read-only queries for
certain model arch one database as gonna

400
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,760
keep all that data in memory

401
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,870
so you can start to feel out pretty
easily that way without a heavy shorting

402
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,700
architecture I to set that up you know I
have some kinda replication

403
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,049
I her cue we make it easy with followers

404
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:15,289
I a lot of service providers try
different things there

405
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:18,590
and injuring yourself there's several
options

406
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,610
some these have been around for a really
long time and their summaries in one so

407
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,760
posh Prescott

408
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,740
a a synchronous I replication around

409
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,789
I forget it either 90 or 91 I'm it's got
a lot more useful

410
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:35,620
on its okay to set up on your own
without any help

411
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,620
and the skilled too tall to hear the
bottom I make a lot easier so while you

412
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,870
something we'd open source

413
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,900
on it runs powers all her record
databases

414
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,520
on for foreign policy stuff I barman is
something out a second quadrant

415
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,659
I Bali is high time it's basically just
the

416
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:57,480
at Sprint report Itasca to get a lot of
utilities to make this easier

417
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,470
I backups so there's two types the
backups

418
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,779
I and post rest most people and I think
about backups they only think about

419
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,159
logical backups

420
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,679
so this is what happens when he ran
keyed up on your database and this is

421
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,309
what most people think I'm as backups

422
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:16,350
I'm a charitable its portable a Thai
people start with

423
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,770
I the other is a %uh as a backup

424
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:23,620
or also known as a base backup on if you
set up replication

425
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,169
you had to do this at some point this is
kinda what powers act I'm just the

426
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:28,870
physical by time desk

427
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,460
this is not crash cross-platform across
architecture dependent

428
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,350
I am it it up promise to be it may be is
some people have said it is so much that

429
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:38,909
it isn't

430
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:43,799
don't rely on this it will break at some
point that's pretty much a guarantee

431
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,230
a little bit a comparison between this
here I logical backups are

432
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,250
by good for you know moving something
from

433
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,230
your production environment on locally I
miss you guys had developing on a Mac

434
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:55,700
person

435
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,919
running on Ubuntu on get for portability

436
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,230
I but has led on the database when he
fired this of it's going to have a lot

437
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,010
on your database

438
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:09,179
impact performance I it works early on
but it stops working at a certain point

439
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,490
especially if your database has slowed

440
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,080
so if you're in now serving traffic I am

441
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,470
it'll have an impact there at South
working at a certain point

442
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,690
I generally the community search
encourage

443
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,130
once you're a big database image
strictly to physical backups

444
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,490
I'm there's a little more initial setup
I but there's limits and no load on the

445
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,250
system

446
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,950
and it scales I essentially everyone its
large-scale

447
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,690
eyes you so kind of a

448
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,230
really quick recap I am a lap

449
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,809
is a whole other talk I am when you're
looking at all applications Desai

450
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:48,970
the scale is really important I'm so
you're looking at

451
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,150
as a seasoned fusion-io the hardware on
the order on desk is

452
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:58,500
helpful important and PD reorg is crazy
thing outta NTT that reordered

453
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,380
bites and Esquire sitting there in your
your databases live in production

454
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,630
works really well as long as you don't
do anything wrong and possibly wipe all

455
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,840
your data

456
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,770
part to that are being examined for
contributed back to progress but it's a

457
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,490
it's a

458
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,360
ways to go to make that safe and then
there's a lot I am pp solutions on top

459
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,890
stress I a lot of data warehousing
project start our

460
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,289
as press I so there's post respite in
there i think im

461
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:31,850
if you look at redshift it even a a long
long long ago post grass

462
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,610
at some point though it they started to
be a pretty far from that

463
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:40,250
on and then for the bulk and SRTP
webapps I mention about commuting is in

464
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,190
cash

465
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,169
on and that you have to get high cash
rate optimize your overall query love

466
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,970
with peace at statements

467
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,010
on check your indexes and then you know
when cash ox at room or at it

468
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,970
it really is an easy way to start the
day these problems I wouldn't be overly

469
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:55,860
wasteful

470
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,330
I but scaling up more memory and it
definitely helps if you're low on cash

471
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:08,330
thanks and I'll take a few questions

472
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:19,429
a great

473
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,969
messed up thanks i was just wondering if
you could talk a little about

474
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:28,019
the whether Herold who uses the vacuum
statement

475
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:31,489
backing analyze yes lol

476
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:35,009
we're we have a heart attack him on all
databases

477
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:39,299
I we don't mean a leak bigger too much
on backing used to be horrible

478
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,009
high-stress

479
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:43,080
now it's just bad I

480
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,519
it's actually gotten a lot better iraq
has pretty good how much you have a

481
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,349
database with

482
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:52,289
super super high load I so are attacking
should keep up

483
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:55,960
on if you look it up on our actual
speedy action as if you search for that

484
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,889
on her IQ

485
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:01,619
I there's a i command line plugin that
charge a lot for researchers like cash

486
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,309
index hit there's also one for bloat I'm
in looking at Dannys

487
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,830
lotus has away at the need to Chiang I a
vacuum or not

488
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,129
I tightest going still Eclair Yorkshire
on her ok you look at

489
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:16,719
your pediatrician and saying out his
plan hi

490
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:20,460
and there's a blunt actor on usually I'd
say something about 5 10 X

491
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,149
as well and okay backing is not doing
its job package weekend thank you

492
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:29,309
a

493
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:33,779
thanks for the talk I'm you talked a lot
about optimizing the database for heavy

494
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,989
reload do you have any advice for either

495
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:40,950
what performance metrics to look at her
how to optimize database for heavy right

496
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,859
loan yet so heavy right low and it's
rare to see

497
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:47,909
on heading right load on you can do a
variety of things

498
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:51,489
I'm depends on how much you care about
your data on you can run us kress

499
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:55,249
I with unlock tables which I consider my
god mode

500
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:58,879
where basically your data center right
really fast but may or may not stay

501
00:28:58,879 --> 00:28:59,299
there

502
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:03,190
I every index

503
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,129
has been a slow that down I mean it's
the biggest thing is over Houston Texas

504
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:10,679
I'm you can get away a lot of that on a
heavy retiree but just because you don't

505
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:11,570
need high throughput

506
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,580
I there's on market indexes

507
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,820
om there's a variety of us question
thanks i'd might look it up

508
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,669
that talk has crashed killing it on your
day job on it gets a little more down to

509
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:23,239
ask

510
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:26,669
makes I don't think there's anything
super high cap to developer level

511
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:33,669
other than don't overuse index is really
when Tyrell

512
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,460
I'm sorry didn't hear you mention
analyze and I've had some pretty big

513
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,710
surprise at some point with some
database that were not analyzed in their

514
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,810
return some harsh

515
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:49,360
quieres so is is is still there needed
with the latest version of that was his

516
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,680
crew

517
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,330
yes OR so around analyze the thing

518
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,430
years you need to run after doing a big
ball club I

519
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,930
once if you're kinda running a fraction
much citing you know you're not doing a

520
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:00,940
lot of bach loads

521
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,050
on and off resort type things then
you're fine

522
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,760
%ah allies I is actually really
important do at a level closer to that

523
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,650
post rest knows to lay out your data

524
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:15,480
I but on the production side night she
wearing because us press is constantly

525
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,640
monitoring and watching this

526
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,980
I so yeah it's it's definitely something
to consider if you're

527
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,990
like doing ETL processes are with allied
data

528
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,840
I but for average production site I
wouldn't worry about it after really

529
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,550
depends I

530
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:34,430
his case thank you you mentioned it

531
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:39,060
very wide open in just a few weeks ago
some other work that's being done

532
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:43,110
for pluggable storage day portable
storage engines in there

533
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,740
potentially column their stores and
stuff like that you elaborate a little

534
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,910
bit on the future that and purrs Chris
over the next few releases

535
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:55,050
so the up talkable storage engine is
definitely speculative

536
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,650
on these people wanted to feel they
don't think me tank or on

537
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,600
there was a car store release has
appointed a rapper by cited state a

538
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,290
last week which is really awesome I'll

539
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:11,230
I think we're gonna see a lot FTW
support on this

540
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,960
and anti-morsi more up I also read
engine I know some companies I can talk

541
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,430
about that has an interest in it

542
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:22,140
I so there's some potential for it but I
think we're definitely looking at least

543
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,540
I year and a half probably
two-and-a-half years before we have

544
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:32,080
I a completely Michael storage where
some really interested in

545
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,700
NH torso when you say keep value store

546
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,530
I actually think about memcache reddish
but if you have a 99 percent

547
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,550
cash hit rate and your cash is in memory

548
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:46,550
it seems like this could be a really
cool way to not have to spend up like a

549
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,300
man cash a reticence in send you
everything in post press

550
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,480
so is that can if the kollek how you see
people actually using each door is this

551
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,540
kind of like where that's going on my

552
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,390
totally of I mean it definitely can I
don't think that's the

553
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,140
top I'm or use case I think it's more
that schema less flexibility

554
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,160
I am so like for us we use it in
whenever a huge production systems at

555
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,210
I'm to check on every database every 30
seconds I me answer all sorts of things

556
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,570
and every week you wanna say hey we want
to measure something new

557
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,530
SN running a migration adding some
columns in may be throwing away a month

558
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,000
later

559
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,220
we just added to our HR I and start
observing at data and it's already index

560
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,910
we can see if it's useful and so we can
I every factor it out

561
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,940
but generally we just leave it there
just because it works performant

562
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,210
I may get a slight asking less
flexibility I'm

563
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,500
there's a lot of stuff for a user
account I may eventually wanna track

564
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,000
I that I can just throw in there I'm

565
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,860
are a nominee email and password but I
mainly I had no idea what else I wanna

566
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,679
track for user

567
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,840
I'm you can get some other functionality
at a

568
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,320
they would use a red predator in cash I
might start there I

569
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,350
I don't like go to too far with it

570
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,980
I I can I could use cases feature fact
right on

571
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,250
you need to rule out future fights for
everything on a feature or me just have

572
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,320
a bucket a future flaxen what some
insight into

573
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,160
I and a lot of people will look at our
restaurant cash sometimes there

574
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,810
I so it depends I would start with a
store

575
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,020
and then as you outgrow it what you will
on

576
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:23,040
register and cast be helpful there okay
that's all we have time for

577
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:30,040
thank you Greg when

578
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,700
in

579
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:45,700
in

580
