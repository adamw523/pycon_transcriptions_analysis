that they need to go to the reception
desk right away to pick up the prize

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,510

through the this week we're gonna have
sprints it is

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,410
probably an amazing time to meet
developers love fantastic projects

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,739
like pie pie and mercurial and

12
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,890
pyramid amongst others there's a chance

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,189
on the planet in this in this in the
city

20
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:19,430
so it is my pleasure to introduce

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,450
Elena Williams we'll be talking to us

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,540
about the Hitchhikers Guide to free and
open source

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:33,540
participation thank you very much yet
thank you

24
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,460
on up well welcome to my talking I'm
thank you for coming and I just wanna

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,009
say on it

26
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:44,460
a real risk running overtime and also my
slider an experiment I'm reacting

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,509
against that I am

28
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,630
helping nothing on a slight upward
everything on the slide it might be very

29
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,490
distracting

30
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,729
but I wanted the slides be a interesting
for people to rate them lighter and

31
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,780
there's a lotta contact I have too much
content

32
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,399
is a crop down from an hour-long talks a
um

33
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,630
this is me I have no time and I'm
standing in front of you

34
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,850
because of this guy and his name is
Andrew tree jokes he also love the async

35
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,129
shell tool and also I love this and the
server which is one of the most

36
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,390
ubiquitous Lee used

37
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,370
open source project in the world I mean
it's probably got be in the

38
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,870
cancellations and it's more than 20
years old

39
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,050
and he has seen it all every controversy
every legal battle

40
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,040
Santa has done it and I'm I knew this
guy at my university but

41
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,580
I thought he was like a really scary
like net and down

42
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,250
tell you and 10 doubt he's wonderfully
charismatic and generous and he die

43
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,830
night

44
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,540
one week if his life I at to do an
autumn session to give a postgraduate

45
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,120
level course to arm teach

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,450
student at a party but not this was the
only one of its kind in the world

47
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,830
all the lectures online at on the
university website and also check much

48
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,800
each even case

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,920
they dispute me anytime I'm so please if
you have a deep on

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,090
interest in open source checked his
watch that because I've all the examples

51
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,090
site stalk always has to start would be
a and as

52
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,590
what he's open source and what we're
talking about is free software but of

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,610
free in terms of exchange for money

54
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,730
internet free in the times all freedom
of space like free to do what you want

55
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,069
to do

56
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,560
and why the time I can source got
involved was in 1998

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,620
a netscape navigator the best very
serious project to

58
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,230
release its cloud publicly and down
because I love being eaten alive by

59
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,230
Internet Explorer

60
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,510
but it was the beginning of the tech
bubble and nobody liked the idea of

61
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,239
using the word

62
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,739
free so they repurposed is 10 open
source

63
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,670
from for only three letter acronym
organization to use that tend to

64
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,170
describe

65
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,360
a proper open source like out like a
publicly available

66
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,099
newspaper fine book or something like
that on I do and Richard you does

67
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,170
so a lot of people are really precious
about these tens

68
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,379
that he is uses them to change the I
will also be using them interchangeably

69
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:58,080
but when I say I can source

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,939
when I main is free software on my site
state otherwise explicitly

71
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,409
so free software exists because of
copyright

72
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:08,519
height we all have an idea as to what
copyright he is

73
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,140
on in that movie industry association
sense

74
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,409
unlike to basically sums copyrighted
what you're allowed to do

75
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:19,650
you can look at it spree much country
anything else to it but the one that

76
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,229
really matters to us

77
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:24,540
is you cannot change it and

78
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,639
that the shooter powder medically it
your eligible for copyright

79
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,449
if you're product is fixed created as an
amazing talk about is a park on last

80
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,070
year I strongly suggest you check it out

81
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,550
on but this makes for some really
interesting copyright exception said you

82
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,199
know i

83
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,840
fashion dance architectural features
recipes automobiles & perfumes

84
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,389
all exemption copyright I have
trademarks

85
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,180
but no copyright sigh I wake up like our
sport is very

86
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,240
very mu and he didn't even make sense
before the soda sixties

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,660
two separate hardware and software isn't
enough for unity 0

88
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,580
you could put on multiple be too hard
with software was a thing at a time

89
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,300
right but

90
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,150
because it's very young hungry at sorry
covered by copyright

91
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,680
and now I'm did you also can't talk
about free software that took met this

92
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,030
guy

93
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,190
and this guy Richard Stallman gets a lot
a very hard time for being a bit have

94
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,830
not job in Ossining talk twice and he is
a little bit crazy but

95
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,870
I do what anyone to underestimate he is

96
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,210
a James even the people who don't like
him

97
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,979
a willing to say he's able to produce
very large quantities extremely high

98
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,389
quality kiting on a full scholarship to
Harvard

99
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:38,770
today the hot that tough and graduated
magna cum laude he's a very very smart

100
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,949
and retrieval had nothing but the
highest price for you and say to

101
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:42,850
continues

102
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,789
but he came up with this idea this hack
on top of copyright

103
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:51,000
we could issue another license that
would give away your copyrights

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,770
and I'm the first GPO was a bit sketchy
but they've been a proliferation of

105
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,340
licenses Inc then

106
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,780
their sixties thankfully the Open Source
Initiative in their 63

107
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,810
recognized licenses and being legally
tested

108
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,080
and will stand up in a court of law to
protect yourself you're right you're

109
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,340
softer way

110
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,160
but night that also least 28 rejected
licenses it look a lot like open source

111
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,100
but actually hunt side you understand
the difference now that

112
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,160
on open source is publicly available
source for free softer is

113
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,699
what let me illustrate these so did you
know I

114
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,240
that the Microsoft cannell a Windows
cannot is publicly available to

115
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,000
academics

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,940
and I'm pretty much always has been so
you can get the the Windows kernel code

117
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,780
and

118
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,800
basically look at it so I N analyze it
if you want but

119
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,220
goodness gracious don't you dare try and
change that code

120
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,350
and if you try to sell those changes on
your lawyers would

121
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,830
dropped from helicopters or something
like that I'm

122
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,990
so and have another really deep in open
source issue and this is a bit dense but

123
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,080
if you have an interest

124
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,130
deep interest check out that lecture
because the

125
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,630
being too tired and what he's interested
his level is at what point

126
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,470
how much that we die source code you
need to change get a really sry

127
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,599
issue a license for itself and the
answer is probably

128
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:09,610
there's no and now to change you can
make I'm

129
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,630
whereas transcript yeah absolutely he
lost to fit it in

130
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,150
hello hello well to get could you
license at to gray area

131
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,190
it's really messy and you have an
interest to get that lecture

132
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,340
arm so what this means him is that

133
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,610
if you look project doesn't have a
license

134
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,580
the author can't simply turn to see if
they wanna their white

135
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,080
but crude I'm nothing is done

136
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,860
always use a um and if one of those
official licensed dozen other things

137
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,210
people just because you're giving way of
suffer for free doesn't mean

138
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,940
that I can turn its soo ewe I am and

139
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,949
and re also this is the first time right
unless it is the first loss in table

140
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:51,650
right any guys blow for blow it all the
problems

141
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,280
without license and they're a big love
and justice he started teaching this

142
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,120
course

143
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,780
um he had been contacted by a lawyer
eighteen years after the fact you can't

144
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,110
willing to resource coach

145
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,539
and he had to go to open up Cody Grimm
Chinese French change it because a

146
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:07,419
lawyer asked him to observe a bad

147
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:10,520
license decision he had made very early
on in the pace

148
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,870
arm site and he want to become a
technical lawyer please do

149
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,039
the record needs more than all the the
CB your lawyers come from the Technical

150
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,250
Community First

151
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,699
%ah if you have legal problems at the
Law Center

152
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,169
if you have a project you want legal
coverage for it to be considered

153
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:30,930
have all this legal open source a a
not-for-profit stuff covered

154
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,919
protect the friends African 70 and give
these people money because these people

155
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,450
he writes

156
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,149
on side why would you want to contribute
to open source

157
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,769
and this is the answer as to why you
wanna can choose I from those but really

158
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,940
what we want as human beings is we want

159
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,820
autonomy mastery and purpose I this is
why people learn how to play musical

160
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,750
instruments

161
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,380
on but more than that to complete allies
what we want is to

162
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,240
feel a sense of connection everything we
do is for these

163
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,769
and down even psychopath one if you
listen to connection but it's just

164
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,110
misguided and all everything about us is
healthier

165
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,380
when we're connected to our fellow man
um

166
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,830
and also we have this incredible prima
donna I can't think of another

167
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,800
discipline

168
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,279
in which from there comfort love your
own comfort you can

169
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,610
I directly 19 it through an intermediary
directly

170
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,570
interact with the very best in your
discipline me nuts extraordinary

171
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,700
and and had become the best when you
interact with those people in you

172
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,519
comes could aspire are also it this is
it kinda

173
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,029
saying that if you have an open source
profile

174
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:42,290
and employees will bo2 know your
capability in your business

175
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,029
Michigan at Vantage 20 love your peers
on and is also these aspect

176
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:49,670
love missed compulsion to want to save
the world and I think

177
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,110
you either have these are you dying to
know this is a very big deal Andrew and

178
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,209
that's something I feel very strongly
about

179
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,790
but a source to be aware that with an
open source not everybody is motivated

180
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,800
by this they will be people who

181
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,070
you know don't have the strongest person
to have their own motivations like I'm

182
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,769
corporation to up essentially and the
other thing is is that we'd

183
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,970
probably write code anyway on I mean I
it's just fun

184
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,820
it's fine if we could write code and
then collaborate with other people who

185
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,890
make things that changed the world a min

186
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,940
that's that's extraordinary hi an

187
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,140
so when I first cabey's talk this was my

188
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,800
take-home message is that all projects a
different so when you're approaching

189
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,950
United new open source project

190
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,660
recognize its differences so is it big
is silly is it serious

191
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,160
II is at the limits Cano is it a little
script

192
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,060
help old is it is at dead is it branch I
knew it at that

193
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,760
bubbly things are really taking off pot
I have the people involved with rose to

194
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,820
the people involved

195
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,820
and what organizational structure like

196
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,079
um bahash we are piped in a week I don't
know if he knew this

197
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,269
um but I before I started researching
this I don't know how much the open

198
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:03,459
source world I thought pike and was back
on

199
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,670
i keeping it was more than expected the
weekend my style via

200
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,040
open source world and this is 2013 early
2014 to

201
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,029
is is Python a some is say

202
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,269
so I reckon for pike in there are
actually two types project

203
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:22,100
and forge ahead is reinforced me by amp
but he's got my case alleging and what

204
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,440
the scratchy shows

205
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,610
is the 265 something project I analyzed
on get help

206
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,060
Ste the vast vast majority in the have

207
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,920
one contributor you know the four
thousand most active projects on k-tel

208
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,529
so many of them only have one
contributor that the median number is

209
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:40,950
chill 1 Nov

210
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,029
contributors for the what has a
most-active I'm so

211
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,470
what this means is you but you really
famous projects that you Django raising

212
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,420
MMK Shinya pythons

213
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,740
arm but the vast majority the project in
the world

214
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,940
out at me all help in the world and in a
small number

215
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,440
they're really really highly refined on
site

216
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,829
if your insight have a dish and idea for
the project Frieda mean you'll have

217
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:05,600
completely different experience
depending on the project

218
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,220
some projects of funny the limits come
I'm looking at you very frank very

219
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,389
high-quality developers leave some
projects going to print

220
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:18,790
ha style am and so where should you find
project

221
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,320
and this is a quote from Scott by it's
not where you are use what you've got to

222
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,519
do what you can

223
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,589
because this is the question I always
get ass next and down

224
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:30,470
this is the true and correct answer to
this question and

225
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,040
I'm sorry pal how does Jess can refinish
H

226
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,120
the eyepatch project it's amazing on but

227
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,690
we thank you be sent to the people have
like it would be the funny in the reason

228
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,269
is

229
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:44,700
is because everyone's abilities

230
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,040
a different so just because you've got a
PhD in computer science doesn't mean

231
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,010
that you baby

232
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,760
you know anything about software
engineering are developed to hear any of

233
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,019
those guys it doesn't mean you know you
know anything about

234
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:58,950
user interface on so I when you try to
find an open source project

235
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,500
its you can see reading you it's what
your interests are and what problems you

236
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,620
wanna solve

237
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,730
and down then at the next at defining
project is learning

238
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,170
to not having a good sense when you're
using

239
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,320
free software which I trust everyone he
does

240
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,570
down and then look been learned to look
at going beyond being a passive user

241
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,510
are look for a date house when you find
a bug don't regard to bug

242
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,630
isolated ami takes the time to write a
dating back report

243
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,860
think about what you're doing and I'm
mideast

244
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,480
dist it takes time and effort and I
think this is it the

245
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,610
might second-biggest message from users

246
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,310
when you want to contribute you first
open source project Scott

247
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,050
small on a case on the first
contribution I ever made was that when I

248
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,389
was doing the subject actually

249
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:51,589
I must poking around in a really large
on project and I'll

250
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,760
notice that the copyright tight hadn't
we still have the phone

251
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,980
and was my ever sent me a and I am and
other anybody important had to do that

252
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,639
they've definitely would have done it by
now so I did I i

253
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,250
when i search not found the source code
I downloaded I kept the change in my the

254
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:06,760
charge

255
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,779
I pushed back whole process took about
eight or nine minutes

256
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:15,190
arm and that shit that is the open
source contribution prices

257
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,459
you find the change that you want to
make you find the source code

258
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:23,670
you make the change and in use send it
back but that it's like a

259
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,449
123 process find it

260
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:32,720
change it retain your contributions open
source is a simple as that

261
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,730
safety first contribution also bear in
mind that

262
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,089
on you're learning how to contribute
when items was project you're not

263
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:40,269
learning the skill

264
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:43,589
that you're trying to do there is no
cash I doing something that's at the

265
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:45,920
edge if your ability in of SQ mi. it

266
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,880
at because they're a very serious
dedicated professional people

267
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,209
you can already do pretty amazing stuff
in the project to give

268
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,410
hundreds and hundreds hours have time to
these projects

269
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,050
and counties bolt up and baby accorded
fell apart like he just

270
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,529
can't there's an ecosystem you work up
the ranks you can

271
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,820
make plugins in integrating between
understand the culture

272
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,850
being a culture of it is a really big
deal like there are people who give a

273
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,440
lot of cutting back to you

274
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,740
on projects you aren't Corp contributors
because in not a good cultural fit

275
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,790
interestingly usually friends like a
week

276
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,130
are site we fun project %uh conference
prints like I

277
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,660
but sin is a sin in a few hours lease
and fine

278
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,410
things in with your domain knowledge
were controls that you want to use

279
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,829
and fine people do you think we're good
things that people you know are working

280
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:33,649
on

281
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,449
so if things you can do is a program on
his a stuffed you do during the day

282
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:42,160
um but also interesting thing to the
different is helping out on i SAT and to

283
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,720
get tree

284
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,180
ticket triage ng anchored to you but

285
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,209
there are some significant differences
in the

286
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,759
software methodologies Ivins was
purchased a close as project and I

287
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,790
believe that this is the biggest one

288
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,480
is it just because you submit a patch
doesn't mean that it's gonna get

289
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,329
accepted

290
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:03,240
I we have this incredible privilege an
open-source

291
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,029
make aspiring to this perfection

292
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:10,829
unlike work money resources and time

293
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:13,990
our no object in open source project

294
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,750
site we can I aim for perfection its
extraordinary

295
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,790
side there's a lot of criticism is in
the

296
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,240
the next version of tanker that's coming
out as a big ray factor fam

297
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,750
the way at selected by my count this is
the fifth

298
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,899
Maggie jet to get major attempt at least
years ago was hammered chiropractic the

299
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:33,410
core developer working on it

300
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,170
that did this very fix this very problem
a year ago and that was rejected

301
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,560
and it was done and the one that's
getting merged

302
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,120
now was based on not a lot about work
but

303
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,180
you are you it has been allotted
rejection let's fuck

304
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,790
another really big deal in arkansas
culture and Andrew felt very

305
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,490
emphatically strongly about this is to
be completely and self-deprecating Lee

306
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,240
truthful

307
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,630
to you you know an extreme so your ego
is

308
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,750
just not welcome United source and a

309
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,140
and is this factor which is I'm sure the
people can't go through the whole entire

310
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,020
careers

311
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,530
and never actually have to engage with
anybody around them

312
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,990
resist you know you I here by choice

313
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,750
and at the long the more interaction we
have the more the longer

314
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,600
your participation is likely to Bay on
another thing you can do is to

315
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,829
ask your employer to give back to me a
project to put an open source license

316
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,919
on it and somebody's person cross
successful

317
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,240
you Django on some things you can do

318
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,110
as at Nankai to now this is something I
would

319
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,100
footage say-so softer development is
very new field amber essentially

320
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,240
open source is not for profit the
not-for-profit version

321
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,570
in other older not-for-profit
organizations like metal some point yet

322
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,059
I recognize

323
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,690
that 50 percent of the paper who were
involved that organization

324
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,840
on not doctors 98 minister to people on
logisticians and technical people

325
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,380
and I think you know I think that is
something in that us

326
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,400
sigh I am as unknown Qaeda

327
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,210
if you are learning to program I would
strongly suggest I encourage you

328
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,580
look at open key projects don't have to
tell anybody

329
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,280
rate route retrieved tickets as I come
in and you

330
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,539
find that my cinema pretty down like
communism

331
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:23,490
pic tighten that kinda thing maybe
eventually you get your head around the

332
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,370
project if you're a tin of patches

333
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,679
but also there's all that other stuff
his translations and

334
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,840
content one of the most in demand

335
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,590
open source contributors in Australia is
a technical rusher

336
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,010
okay so I am Nick site I'm not talking
to program is in the range all the

337
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:40,679
program is

338
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,480
block your ears and i can say this
because this is my second korea

339
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,490
am and I think there's a and

340
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,559
misconception that if somebody knows
something a lot about a certain topic

341
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,140
that people in shame

342
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,730
that that applies to all demanding a
legion that's kinda not

343
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,110
trees are on regularly surprised by
things that I can to the second nature

344
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,900
that seems really really smart people
who act just

345
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,010
dying night and I am and

346
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,890
the tricky isn't trying retreat and out
there is

347
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,299
so if you're a capitalist then I'm

348
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:17,039
night you will be OK say the guy he's
been programming since he's I hate

349
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,630
is not scary he's probably gonna be
embarrassed about that so he you're okay

350
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,549
with that

351
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,100
he'll be okay with that and you have

352
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,760
every right to be here site

353
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,150
eat day I carry that on my other advice
you're not program is learn to use get

00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:45,289
learned years ago we and again has a
reputation for being recalled

358
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:49,200
they say you have to be a genius to end
user markets rubbish I think we have to

359
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,559
do

360
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,770
is concentrate so when you make a mess
in your browser

361
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,980
just take a step back have a Breda and
focus on it step-by-step

362
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,659
methodically its it's not as Inc bad as

363
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,049
people make it out to be site really
quickly had a project on a

but

366
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,770
for use a point of view I'm not at a

please please let me install your
project this is the first step in

373
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,789
country

374
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,289
I have create and open source project I
just

375
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:35,190
change in Brighton United make my time
at it and work on the project and I

376
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,309
couldn't use it um was so you in my big
graphic

377
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:42,760
how most open source project have only
got one contributor

378
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,100
on if you -ism another misconception
that if you

379
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,210
make your kite public then paper will
just

380
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,240
want to contribute to it but that's just
not true like you want

381
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,860
he would actually contribute to your
party first has to be pretty good

382
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,590
project but

383
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:01,070
also you need to be be really clear with
the kind help that you want

384
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,450
sigh I'm also of English are of a
recognition

385
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,650
and for people who are involved

386
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,799
have and this is a really kinda personal
thing

387
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,880
but there is a lot of rejection I but I
said I

388
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,600
automatically reject things because
humans more than anything else in the

389
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,110
world

390
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,780
we hate rejection and no matter how in
bed somebody's in a project for how long

391
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,710
they've been around a confident by %ah

392
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,870
a rejection by Kelly to believe you dies
in SciTech you gonna reject me make it

393
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,250
okay for that might decide

394
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,340
most the time you've got a good race and
drop them in I tell you I would not get

395
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,669
back to someone else's work anything
it's a subsidy

396
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:44,169
that just do that don't let people just
went out to an automated system

397
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,650
deciding am you never know are you might
have

398
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,200
leanest stoneman 19 min in your
community and

399
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,590
you might say something that a in
essence honey singh just always

400
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,520
you know they nice and my tree
communities nice today

401
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,140
on and but people will change by virtue
of being in

402
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:10,010
open source I these people are pretty
self motivated and smart and creative in

403
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,220
they gonna move on and that's daddy
screw like people should move on

404
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,710
and project leader should move on to a a
burnout and

405
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,940
Chan its its a thing and it's cool it's
fine

406
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,419
site I'm right near the end like I'm
totally in the highest-rated my talk I

407
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:25,690
am

408
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,950
what I'm I'm gonna do n/a Ravenscroft
did and I'm gonna hijacked my questions

409
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,350
which is

410
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,929
I would love as my first question for
somebody who

411
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:37,100
isn't currently indictments was
participate he hasn't had my

412

like now on and first Telus if you

414
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,470
want a but something that you can do
like something that you're really good

415
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,070
at

416
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,900
and the kind of project you'd like
interest in going on although I am

417
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,900
the kind of things you feel have been
your Baria

418
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,270
to you being involved a plea hidden

419
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,760
and say kids have really I really want
to hear from people who

420
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,080
who I'd you know not sure %ah

421
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,169
sadist some my first things I please

422
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:12,350
communicate this is a massive deal in
open source I it might my personal

423
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,510
theory that ninety-five percent of human
problems are caused

424
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,480
by Paul communication and they will also
be solved by

425
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,190
good communication

426
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,140
and if anybody can think a problem
problems that aren't gonna be really

427
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,520
interested him

428
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,429
explain your problem very clearly in
bold letters on the front middle don't

429
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:33,120
rapid in all this fluff

430
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,210
be tests and short and get to the point

431
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,340
on do what you say you're gonna do I
this is a real

432
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,450
temptation when you start getting
involved something like this you wanna

433
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,720
on oh yeah I'll do that I'll do that but

434
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,159
only say that resist that temptation an
issue

435
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,360
evil you already there I

436
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,250
also a if you do decide to do something
you having a bit hard time

437
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,559
don't agonize I come everybody has gone
through developmental process to have

438
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,510
been at the state today you're at site

439
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,850
now probably 90 bit on don't feel bad
about

440
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,980
askin so I have this incredible
privilege a few years there wasn't a

441
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,520
problem

442
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,840
couple of projects with this guy and I'm
whose

443
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,169
by any measure like smart rat on

444
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:22,279
and he was so quick to say I don't like

you leverage or Billy did say I don't
know I and down

449
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,610
pie Danny was giving this to a
confession to Joe developer a few years

450
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,400
ago

451
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,640
please check it out I his rule of thumb
in the world from the head at nasa

452
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,080
his stepfather an hour disco ask some
money

453
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,270

finished I do have some some little
trees and I will say so

456
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,289
if somebody takes a job inside Redmond
ore Palo Alto that you're like not

457
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:09,470
totally not cool. with

458
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,039
um don't backstab them I'll probably be
back

459
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,200
it's a really small community yank don't
you know and make things on their future

460
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,890
shift also I don't criticize somebody's
technical solutions are working if

461
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,000
somebody's running the open source
project

462
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,520
through a system of complicated Excel
spreadsheet they don't want to be doing

463
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,320
that either

464
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,500
but it's currently working and don't
make it harder than it should be by

465
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,000
giving them a hard time about that

466
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,460
unless you're willing to fix it and I
got this from a tweet

467
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,770
about a year and a half ago money from
someone in this rain actually that

468
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,140
doing criticized other projects

469
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,169
site for the proprietary well have you
got a problem tonight it was pretty

470
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,900
don't blog or tweet about it

471
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,690
contact the project my kitty cat or just
don't say anything at all

472
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,659
when it's kinda tough Italy's top white
stuff but somebody made him mad like I

473
00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:00,340
UK you could do something like that and

474
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,600
very lastly I'm if everything

475
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,679

just he is always so long as you come
back and

481
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,490
also the very last thing you can do to
contribute

482
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,659
open source if everything else is too
much simply say thank you find at the

483
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:30,510
project I know

484
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,570
the project that you love hiya Pike on
what's in them

485
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,070
email these things always save people's
lives like in the Dark Knight when

486
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,470

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,220
you can wait look at that needle save
your life and that comes from people who

488
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,529
don't participate

so I'm if I do have a minute thing I do
I'm are personally have to say thank you

490
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,659
the Pythian divest grant I'm absolutely
would not be standing here

491
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:56,740
if it went to disarm because obviously
he hum

492
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,860
I'm have this conspicuous physical
difference and I never

493
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,279
came to conferences never ever I was
completely invisible in the shadows for

494
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,779
you like the best part ten years and
down

495
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:11,220
I was desperate to be involved community
but I would never ever turn up to attend

496
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,740
a conference

497
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,309
the for my first Pythian conference the
diet last a

498
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:18,630
registration had my finger hovered over
the button and I don't have any friends

499
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,789
going and I was like

500
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:23,140
not I'm not gonna go I just dying want
that feeling like

501
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,179
walking in and no way and then a couple
weeks later I got the email for the

502
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,600
diversity granite changed my world

503
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,679
site I just wanted to mention that and

504
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,270

and animated you

507
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,960
cya placed I get Alice

508
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,279
hi a it's not that I have been made
contributions to open source but I

509
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,580
I think to ticket and get help aren't
too much too many

510
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,679
I am a 10 my problems a

511
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,940
with a contributing to open source is
that

512
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,710
back like four years ago I i try to make
a contribution

513
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,080
and they were total jerks that made me
back of

514
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,390
I'm since trying to come back little by
little but one of the problems that I

515
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,409
have is that

516
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:32,340
I don't know exactly what I like or what
I do well

517
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,140
wow that's a really interesting

518
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,140
point I mean in the open source
community like

519
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,840
for my day job I obviously helps things
that I do very well

520
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,429
but in I don't know how to translate

521
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:50,460
that too be useful to yeah I would I
think is that it

522
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,720
this in it the third part of that which
is papal site on

523
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,149
if you do have friends here or new
friends here all the conference %uh the

524
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:00,190
spring to coming out

525
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,320
often people iight mice the project I've
ever been involved with have come at a a

526
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:05,970
conference

527
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,690
rates and you just kind of an hair and
at the table and on

528
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,429
you know talks might full advert things
that you feel confident that you can do

529
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:16,450
and obviously by virtue of being in that
environment i

530
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,789
want you today say I'm

531
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:22,970
I don't know that's a strategy I'd
suggest an down you know have fun in

532
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,029
communities where people

533
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:29,720
I'm attend I cannot talk

534
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:36,720
meant went back in as much yes I did
have another comment haircut picky

535
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:41,039
I'm pretty terrified

536
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,860
the solvent thing and just getting into
it but yeah

537
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,500
care my worst i cant cuz I'm a little
bit

538
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,909
but it did I feel like I think it's easy
for me to make my table fixes and

539
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:55,700
spelling corrections but it's hard for
me to make that leap to

540
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,320
actually some code so like what do you
think

541
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,450
could help hang around just hair and
kicking ties and fix is in

542
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,230
become familiar first start talking to
people

543
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,809
am I sooner or later you'll find that
you wanna bite off more

544
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:18,049
it'll happen the other way around like I
you naturally you look

545
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,280
understanding up the projector working
on increase

546
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,789
and you just it will happen T an issue
just keeping you and you end up talking

547
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:26,559
a paper you

548
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,870
stott understand it better just by
having conversations right now to avoid

549
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,260
it I imagine say

550
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,409

but the it's not a question its

571
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,860
a something I wanted to say that it
throughly cool to hang around

572
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,419
open source product at another the we
have this

573
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:05,399
supper channel for from simply log onto
and often people come to

574
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:10,010
honor to ask a specific question with
for their specific problem

575
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,030
but the days stay around a little bit
longer

576
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,240
and they see other people answering
questions

577
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,370
and later on when no no none of the
experts

578
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:25,590
I around some other comes and asks one
of the popular questions again

579
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,159
and they remember to ask her so they day

580
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,350
help those people yeah even though they

581
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,070

as possible that's awesome

588
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,510
thank you had obvious I as a quick
question about

589
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:01,970
I

590
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,140
you know because the open source
projects like observed pretty much

591
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,150
seem to be well hind engines they're
running you just say everyone kinda in

592
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:11,820
think

593
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:16,370
it's like a factory up a guy critical I
think misconception

594
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,920
lol me for pro-life observing us okay

595
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,550
gorgeous would reject had observed urban
a novelist narcotic seems like a

596
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:28,560
where do I insert my sock is everyone
seems to be conover you are running and

597
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,510
going to like nothing I said at the
beginning that's why I want there's one

598
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,960
other point on it might really strongly
really early

599
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,390
that there is a small number of projects
that happen like really tight and I'm

600
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,490
like exactly what you described love
serious professional dedicated committed

601
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:42,900
people

602
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,520
but most projects on-site you have two
strategies eighty you can handle is

603
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,390
really big project and he feel like

604
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,910
you're involved enough to contribute or
be involved with one another

605
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:56,820
other ones that pic some really obscure
thing that somebody just

606
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,420
smashed out one night and I probably
need everything for like now

607
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,930
they'll be desperate for your website or
documentation or

608
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:08,150
like feature feeling ano something like
that so I yet it depends on which

609
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,290
strategy prefer to imply that this

610
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,950
tons all the work that needs to be done
thank you

611
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:20,950
project

612
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,990
I can I may be on the whole to chat to
people more like I'd love to

613
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:28,740
talk to people in here tables
experiences thank you very much for
