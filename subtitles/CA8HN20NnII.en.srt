hi everyone

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,829
I so we're good redhead as a community
engagement lead and just got fed

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,960
I'm in a border the ED initiative and
implementation and need initiative the

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,120
organizations that

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,890
works in supporting women in open
technology and culture

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,430
and a deacon opened Asian a is an
organization that supports

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:56,430
as it known destined for Linux and as
I'll be talking about the outreach

16
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,129
program for women

17
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,170
and it has its origins in 2006

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,260
a when going home received a 181
applications for Google Summer of Code

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,070
and none of them appeared to be from
women and Google Summer of Code is a

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,700
program where Google paid

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,159
a stipend for students to work remotely
was a mentor for three-month

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,110
are on have free software project and

23
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,360
I'm when and Chris Bowen Hannah will
look at %uh so this was a key that we

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,270
didn't get any

25
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,150
applications from women say put together
and two months program

26
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,530
are just that very seen summer that
invited women to participate directly

27
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,880
and had an

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,000
a more collaborative language are so
instead of an

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,380
thing prove you're a rockstar show
you're the best

30
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,740
and it was talking about how this is an
opportunity

31
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,659
to work with a mentor and learn and the
received about a

32
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,740
100 applications and six women

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,759
did internships with known that summer
from

34
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,020
and then nothing happened for and

35
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,100
a couple years and in 2009 I find myself
to be wanna

36
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,770
that eight women added numbers and
annual conference

37
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,569
and I'm I was perhaps one of the most
devilish

38
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:13,709
female developers in going home at the
time and money

39
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,379
outnumbered approached me to organized
as the

40
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:20,840
outrage from for women or renew our
outreach initiatives to

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,989
and before a dead bin

42
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:27,569
into how the program works

43
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,250
this is like a very strong much meeting
for the program

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,810
and things like this happen this is a
from this year were

45
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,519
one of the participants the in a picture
of a woman was approached to 10

46
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,260
I for them bowed western wear while many
men

47
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,260
told her that they were surprised to see
girls there and

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,209
this is why it's very important to have
support communities for women

49
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,790
am to I'm kinda showed each other that
yes we

50
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,569
do belong here and also it's important
to have a bomb

51
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:02,620
people working on I'm

52
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,340
in a dedicated way on provided in best
practices

53
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,260
resources such as wood at the ED
initiative does and the geek feminism

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,400
wiki and

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,170
I like to encourage everyone to him read

56
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,510
am a recent blog post by the eat
initiative

57
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,170
are called break-ins a unicorn mom Anne

58
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,930
you know carlos know that any woman in
free software will sooner or later be

59
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,480
asked to do a talk about being a woman
and free software

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,890
and so I II EE we r

61
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,049
break-in the them already

62
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,860
but this blog post also provides great
resources

63
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,209
for how you can find out and about the
experience a women in free software

64
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,700
without approaching new women in your
community

65
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,830
directly and asking them to represent
all other women and where

66
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,569
like how you can get more women
participating so instead recommend

67
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,709
reading this blog post it had the
resources

68
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,750
arm in particular supporting initiatives
such as that which room for women

69
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,560
the aid initiative I'll paying attention
to the Korea Development

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,620
of women you're working with and takin

71
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,459
as the ED initiative allies workshop or
going over the resources that are online

72
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,549
art that can I'm that cover how to

73
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:25,070
respond to sexist incident and how to
best support women

74
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,660
be so in terms of the outage from for
women

75
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,740
it is them there are similar to Google
Summer of Code we have a

76
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,930
paid a three-month into am

77
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,470
remote internships from and as they
happened twice a year one run happens

78
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,530
from May to August

79
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,860
and now they're around happens from at
December to March

80
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,000
the difference ours that it open to all
women that have to be students

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,320
and we also learned that it's important
to

82
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,490
state explicitly that its open to

83
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,520
women that I'm to people who have fun

84
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,320
there is gender identities so it's open
to women who assist entrance into

85
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,750
gender queer people and the default

86
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,590
language I'm is a exclusive

87
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,949
Inc exclusivity fold so which is why for
example it is important for us to say

88
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,070
that it's open to women

89
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,860
this entrance in all our major
announcement for flyers

90
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,330
and also and non-coding projects such as
documentation and design

91
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,300
are available as part of the program in
addition to the coding project from

92
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,270
be and we've had a seven rounds have
internships

93
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,720
130 participants was all those
organizations

94
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,270
and be the sum of the sponsors that I'd
like to think a big thank you to you

95
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,639
well and also redhead contributes my
time to organize in the program

96
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,330
and Ropes & Gray the law firms that
health helped as drafted

97
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,060
contracts for participants and mentors

98
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,509
so how we do it M in addition to address
in

99
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:08,319
a purchase a band the audience that were
true targeting directly

100
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,600
and been open to non students in un
codice a very important part of the

101
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,900
program is that it has

102
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,250
abt a collaborative application process
to so all the mentors

103
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,419
for particular organization are listed

104
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,430
online on the organization beat and what
we ask %uh

105
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,880
applicants to do is to connect it was a
mentor during the application process

106
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,360
and a meek contribution

107
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,380
and with as mentors help that is
relevant to the project that they're

108
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,400
proposing

109
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,850
to work on and that really serves as
them

110
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,440
something that allows all the applicants
to learn how to contribute to free

111
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,780
software community

112
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:52,780
and also served as a very important
selection criteria for us through

113
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,280
and during the program at the time at

114
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,509
to focus for the interns and to build
their experience

115
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,240
contributing to free software and

116
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,340
very importantly we ask %uh participants
are

117
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,800
to blog every two weeks and we
incorporate

118
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,039
other blogs on me organizations planets
and also on the women

119
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,949
increase of Triplanetary which is it's a
great planet I recommend reading it it's

120
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:22,319
I find it very inspirational I also

121
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,930
as part of the program we have a five
hundred dollar

122
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,139
travel alone and the participants can
use it

123
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,630
to travel to a conference for to an
event where they can meet

124
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,020
a mentor in the community do

125
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,460
and up to the ProBook after the program

126
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,740
I the mentorship continues and we have

127
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,220
I'm I will talk to participants about
their career interests those

128
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,840
as someone her hers were has done a
tremendous job

129
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,330
talking to two people participate in the
program in talking to the mentors a bad

130
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,740
how we need to I be proactive about

131
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,770
address in as the participants future
career plans

132
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,270
and be we encourage

133
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,840
as the participants to go in and
presented conferences

134
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,539
and here for them politically cues from
Jessica because the

135
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,650
she has been just done a tremendous job
getting

136
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,160
people I'm I'm getting women to
presented

137
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,660
Aiken by asking everybody including me
in

138
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,379
I took a cue from her in for example for
a lot

139
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,769
aquatic I A have aft women who
participated as interns and other women

140
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:34,050
in it numb community

141
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,550
and and that helped produce dramatic
results for how

142
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,209
the number of speakers increased I am
forgot ok

143
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:45,279
so as good it's it's it's extremely
important out to ask women in your

144
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,110
communities

145
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,680
a.m. to propose talked to conferences

146
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,339
and also one thing that I'd like to
touch on is them often when we talk

147
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,120
about the internship like this

148
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,709
am people talk about return on
investment arm

149
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,769
how dole I'm whether

150
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,100
the people who did the internship
whether they stuck around and this is

151
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,470
something picked up from

152
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,440
Leslie howitzers dog which is basically
it's okay that they

153
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,810
if they have moved on it it was a
privilege for us to have been able to

154
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,820
share our values with them

155
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,360
and people are exploring and they will
carry on those values but it might not

156
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,470
be was

157
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,790
your project or I'm

158
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,950
with the same kinda field but is just
very important already that will work

159
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,519
able to influence

160
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:38,350
I how they think about the world and
what's possible

161
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,820
I'm so we've had about forty women it
lies to help

162
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,029
noms conference

163
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:48,380
and we had ten women speakers and this
is a

164
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,120
for be on a CMOS and she's them talking
about how to rip

165
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,190
work your user experience bug

166
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,450
based in her masters I see sleuth

167
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,630
and she was them a participant in the
program was going home

168
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,000

a leader in

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,180
outreach to women as well and I'm

170
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,720
the /url by Tim project has joined arm

171
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,149
the outreach group for women for this
round and

172
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,529
I'm the were 14 applicants who worked
with the mentor

173
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,190
are to complete a contribution and if
you would like to help with this effort

174
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,589
going forward

175
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:30,000
please join the choir mentorship list
which is where all the

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,410
our communication with the applicant's
happen

177
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,750
and I'm the project that that people
will work and I

178
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,510
in three areas: it them graphical bison

179
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,060
am male libraries for bison and also
improve in

180
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,360
experience documentation and features
for biting on Windows

181
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,399
and of course the number women I'm

182
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,640
given a toxic by some health risen
dramatically

183
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,970
well and here's some project that

184
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,430
people have done in Python as part of
the outreach program for women

185
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:10,089
so those are just representative over
bomb

186
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:14,040
in sir abut typical

187
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,769
a project that interns complete during
their internships

188
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:20,779
and not surprisingly for the people have
misled

189
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,490
on my plate here are they are by
couldn't so

190
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,940
up Stacy Marta Terry in Sindhi

191
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,820
artbuy can quit because the they done
projects and bison

192
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,160
those days it'd a terrific I am talk
about

193
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,930
twisted on Friday here and during her
inch

194
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,360
internships she worked about honor API
documentation for

195
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,990
I'm twisted am meal and she also wrote

196
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,130
am SMTP client and server tutorial them

197
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,600
I Martin ilene I worked in no and marcia
did

198
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,010
am a beginner's tutorial for writing

199
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,790
up no obligations in Payson and she has
also presented

200
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,750
a poster about that I can last year and
the theater poster

201
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,320
at pagan was them but how to go to from
a beginner

202
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,550
in buys into an intermediate level

203
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,399
what to do and Elaine worked on them

204
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,810
I it for getting things going on which
is the task manager

205
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,209
foot known and she added geolocation two
tasks and tender than allowed

206
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:30,360
I am soaring tax tasks based on the
proximity

207
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,820
to the user I tasha Reign worked

208
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,630
on now um gazebo Robert simulator for
outdoor environment

209
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,850
and her project she rodin OpenStack
plugin

210
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,389
the a ser OpenStreetMap plugin and it
took

211
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,959
the information from are OpenStreetMap

212
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,910
I and up elated out in a simulated
environment so she'd represent

213
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,700
buildings as polygons a street signs
three Clydes

214
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,260
roads and including as a tech sure if
the road in the number of lanes

215
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,380
houses there was her project and several
interns worked on OpenStack

216
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,620
and Victoria did I'm user interface
improvements

217
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,089
i'm for the horizon dashboard Terry
worked

218
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,190
on them 13 absurd API options

219
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,950
our fourth la mettre metering module
then a

220
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,850
Sayali I'm to the data from the slum in
a murine model

221
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,930
and did graft are to represent the data
in the

222
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,040
in the presidential board and Cindy
worked on them

223
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,199
improved login and error handling

224
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,720
out for the team out for the

225
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,740
a application messaging API called
marconi

226
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,800
though all really cool project very
successful

227
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,000
and I'm or Linux kernel community is
also produce Peyton

228
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,410
in that age group for women and here you
can see how

229
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,019
7 interests who worked with the kernel
out last summer

230
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:09,850
I'm did more contributions then some of
the industry leaders

231
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,820
well and this is a summary ovum

232
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,079
interns accomplishments people go on to
do talks find employment with sponsoring

233
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,570
organizations

234
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,089
I'll good do Google Summer of Code a
hacker school

235
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,600
I become mentors I'm really cool things
have

236
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,800
happened I was a alarm is star in their
own initiatives

237
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,959
Mac fourth started at Chicago and hiking
and gone group

238
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,680
Martha too much started in a row be deaf
school which is similar to hackers cool

239
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,889
as the tub dedust hurted are women in
free stuff for a group in India

240
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,680
are and you could during the caress
mother became at North addition board

241
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,180
member

242
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,430
and also improve in arm on ramps for
women in

243
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,610
in the ban on community have helped us
improve on ramps for all newcomers

244
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,880
the for example the are mentors list
that was started for the program

245
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,670
has grown to be a general resource in
was over forty mentors that

246
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,959
any newcomer can approach am anytime

247
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,240
are to get started with the project and
also are we took such lessons there them

248
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,350
engage in participants I during the as
the

249
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,399
contribution process during the
application process

250
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,079
to have the make a contribution and work
was a mentor during that time and also

251
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,490
have in them blog am at least every two
weeks about their work in

252
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,290
aggregating blog post and planet known
and and and that improves

253
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,370
the engagement of the participants with
the

254
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,490
community a a lot

255
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,790
and am so we're almost done with the
selection process was this round and

256
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,279
will have

257
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,050
internships from May to August and then
the next run

258
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,579
attended a little have an application
deadline in October and

259
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,470
internships from December to March

260
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,139
and beyond that so we have a good idea
of how to run

261
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,399
a program I for women I'm

262
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,800
to help them build this experience to
start contributing to free software

263
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,660
I'm and I'm would like to see like

264
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,899
who else that we not reaching an to the
value that

265
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:24,949
I'd like to mention two initiatives that
are I'm close to my heart that

266
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:28,269
I i doing a tremendous work I'm from

267
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,410
other directions are so the aid
initiative

268
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,899
works in I'm helpin conferences adopt
anti-harassment policies

269
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:39,730
organize in he did camp switcher
conferences for women

270
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,589
interesting in her working on improving
when power

271
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:47,990
improving participation of women in open
technology and culture

272
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,290
it are runs them allies workshops

273
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,870
the Chiefs to cheat teach Alice kills
about how to support women

274
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,139
and help sexism and it also creates

275
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,810
best practices resources other blogs
just fantastic

276
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,049
they already mentioned and open hatch

277
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,250
om has an initial words the

278
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,459
I'm have a curriculum for open source
comes to campus workshops which a

279
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,640
full-day workshops for students

280
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,199
to learn about how to contribute to free
software and

281
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,510
um they often work with women in
Computer Science Group on campuses

282
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:29,620
so their workshops typically have a
lotta women participating in them

283
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,140
be I silicon and dad

284
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,720
I am other metric that we have

285
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,870
I'm when women participation in Google
Summer of Code has

286
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,530
outgrown over the years and it's a in
producers outreach parable: women

287
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,100
because

288
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,240
we encourage women who are called urs
and

289
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,690
students who qualify for Google Summer
of Code to apply for Google Summer of

290
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,429
Code

291
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:57,289
are also initiatives such as open hatch
an aid initiative

292
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,350
help create a supportive clomid

293
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,340
and Google's own open source OfficeTeam

294
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,090
does some outreach work as well up but
also google has the Google Code in

295
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,870
which is a program for high schools
students to contribute to free software

296
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,820
and out ovum forty grand prize winners
in the last two years

297
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,770
only one with the girl and and when I
saw this

298
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,789
data I was like I work is cut out for us
was at risk for a buoyant

299
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:30,090
so I'm I'd like to do something about it
and I would like to do is the

300
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,720
I've been talking to open hatch about
how we can I'm

301
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,500
try to tailor their curriculum are to
take those workshops

302
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,260
to up girl couldn't group

303
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,220
I am so would need others a group to
have already

304
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,960
I'm learn some code is a reasonable can
work with that girls a black girls code

305
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,710
and I introduce growth there to
contribute into free softer and also

306
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,510
offer a

307
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,330
in person mentorship I just in general
in contributing

308
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,490
a two-fer suffer but also in
participation in Google Code and once we

309
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,970
figure that out

310
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:11,210
I'll we can ask other people in our her
program alumnae and mentored network and

311
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,929
just general the broader community for
everybody to just go to

312
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:19,059
one high school class 01 to girls group
in your area

313
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,679
and am offer this workshop

314
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,910
an offer in in person mentorship or like
you could need

315
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:31,030
are without the student at a library in
can help her

316
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,780
contributed to free software project and
hopefully we can

317
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,950
we can change those numbers and and also
said

318
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:43,100
mention that I'm there have been at 10
percent girls participate in

319
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,240
in Google Code in in last year but jazz
at nine of them

320
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,030
went on to to be at grand prize winner

321
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,870
well so looking at some other statistics

322
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,750
I'm a lot a bomb practically

323
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,059
all are participants in the last year in
at Richboro for women

324
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,159
have had a higher education away pursue
in one only

325
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,789
only two arm had some college education
but were no longer pursuing it

326
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:14,179
so we're not reaching people who are
less advantaged

327
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:19,520
and don't have access to higher
education

328
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,740
also looking at the geographical data at
the country's here are the countries

329
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,890
that had more than one participant

330
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,000
in outreach from for women so that it's
a little bit of an arbiter list but

331
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,659
I'm the point is here to show that all
those countries are

332
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:37,650
indifferent but ways am are represented

333
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,679
in phnom others for for women Google
Summer of Code Ann

334
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,090
of lost sir be I'll but the I'm

335
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,360
you know they're all fairly well
represented

336
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,380
on other hand we can home

337
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,130
look at the countries that were not
reaching at all with them an opportunity

338
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,169
to contribute to free software because

339
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:59,320
they have been barely at represented in

340
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,590
in any of those venues well

341
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,280
and also I'll we don't have data for
this between on a daughter lizard

342
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,090
sir few people of color in our
communities and

343
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,669
one interest in our point is that in
United States

344
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:18,960
um the number of people of color

345
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,470
getting computer science degrees is
roughly similar to their representation

346
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,580
in in the general population but we're
just not seen them in our communities

347
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,299
and legs disparities in the way similar
to how

348
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:36,080
other 18 percent over bob women I get in
computer science degrees in United

349
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,730
States

350
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,070
but before all the outreach efforts we
had about 23 percent are women

351
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,799
are participating in free software

352
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,490
I'll so average from for women we are
thinking about it

353
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,950
I'll in ways to expended

354
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,240
to make it an outreach program for
under-represented people to expend more

355
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,190
broadly but would

356
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,860
do need to figure out like how we
expended in gentle ways because

357
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,690
right now we typically have thirty to
forty participants around and

358
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,090
and we need to know how to grow gently
I'll

359
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,659
a very cool initiative that a look at
the block has started at Muslim

360
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:17,510
is them the send project and inert

361
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,640
hershey's them targeting people that

362
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,169
I'll are underemployed I'm lesbian gay
bisexual transexual a queer

363
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:29,450
latina african-american First Nations

364
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,020
basically people who are
underrepresented in underprivileged

365
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,980
and its them the they're gonna have a
stick with six-week pilot

366
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,980
in Portland and the new orleans and

367
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,980
the goal is to make it manageable for
people who live paycheck to paycheck

368
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,950
and they're gone accomplices Bay are
having a fifty dollar

369
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,740
birdie honorarium for the attendees
providing laptops

370
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,010
providing food add and transit passes

371
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,549
and the successful participants gonna
receive a laptop

372
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:04,220
me and has it that they can continue
building on a skills

373
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,260
and the goals I'll all bomb this boot
camp

374
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,400
gonna be too see two participants
JavaScript

375
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,860
are techniques hour for contributing to
free software

376
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,289
build automated tests for Mozilla and
talk about what opportunities are out

377
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:19,990
there

378
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,049
what are the next steps introduce them
to people

379
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,080
arm and as in this is terrific and

380
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,179
one is the ticket was for me for example
that are

381
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,480
after going through this program people
will be arm

382
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,220
very good candidates for the I fish room
for the underrepresented people which

383
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,110
have which is like the format the same
format as at Richboro for women that we

384
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,020
wants to all voters prefer women into
and

385
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,220
you can watch this basis and project at
work if you I would like to know more

386
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,659
about this initiative and the ways you
can help with

387
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,640
that you can be a teaching assistant if
you were in Portland on New Orleans so

388
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,929
you can come and present

389
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:01,679
about your work %uh so come find me a
Lucas or

390
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,940

I the results of those two pilot
programs and I'll be looking for

396

partners to replicate the season in
other areas

397
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,830
in other geographical locations

398
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,510

419
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,080
then

420
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:55,080
well good for questions don't thank you
so much

421
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,830
and we do have time for questions
there's only one my kids over here so

422
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,870
please cue up

423
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,230
over here

424
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,720
question um

425
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,900
high action a buncha questions but old
just us one right now

426
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,390
I am an order something really
interesting your stats about the number

427
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,299
participants but by country

428
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:20,150
no India overall was huge

429
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:24,000
but it was smaller I mean the

430
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,190
proportion between the the top tourism
reversed

431
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,960
between women in and the and general G
sock

432
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,010
yeah is it the more interestingly it's
there's it's even more drastically

433
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,010
rivers between who's a flaw serbia
reached

434
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:43,960
yes so so as I think I'm the way I can
explain it is dead

435
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,640
Google Summer of Code is our hugely
popular in India it has

436
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,490
Google brand on it I and

437
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,789
are also the stipend as if fifty five
hundred dollars stipend is

438
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:59,100
is a very substantial amount of money to
to get in India

439
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,210
%uh so which is why I think it's I'm

440
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:07,580
the Google Summer of Code is I so
popular in India and

441
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,289
and is a little less popular but so
popular in United States

442
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:15,570
on the other hand I United States has so
many participants in at risk from for

443
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,309
women because we have so many

444
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:20,659
support group Women in Technology Group
that

445
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:24,740
I developed more much more so than in
Europe there are definitely some in

446
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,500
India

447
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,240
I'm so i think is just that they are so
developed in the United States

448
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,590
but also kinda looking at the number for
how many people participate in the flow

449
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,270
story which

450
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,000
I do believe was spread widely to the
different communities and I think that

451
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,169
shows us how many

452
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:44,669
people consider themselves on

453
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:47,730
established receptor contributors arm

454
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:52,480
in so up basically how many people I
relatively image country go on

455
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,890
to continue contributed to free software
and and be connected on als me llamaste

456
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,669
