1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,160
hello everybody %uh I'm here to present

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,390
lights the flame will be speaking about

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,559
upgrading your web development will
change please welcome him

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,330
within plus well

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,660
lol thank you so welcome to my

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,320
a Brit your web development to chain
that time give so

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,830
as usual and what about me so I'm doing
a full well at full stack web

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,730
development

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,730
I mostly lead project and teams that

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,260
and still learning a lot everyday
probably

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,980
as love you so what this talk is about

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,930
in fact this stock is about more ID's
and patterns

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,070
it's about combining two it's also about
working with people's a

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,190
people on project it's not about

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,379
let's see strong opinions because I'm
not there over

16
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:00,660
a punitive guy it's not about to

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,250
cookbook recipies do and it's not
in-depth technical

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,689
examples and I'm open to everything so

19
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,900
if you want to discuss anything about
what I'm talking today after

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,509
I'll be a happy to talk with neru so

21
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,799
the talk was planned under the best
practices

22
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,270
and patterns so let's just talk a bit
about that

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,030
and dogmatism is never a good thing

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,820
I think being like close to

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,810
order ID's is not a good idea in itself
and

26
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,159
I try to not be dogmatic about what I
just said that

27
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,450
but I think is the right way to be open
to others

28
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,030
and it should always at this significant

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,680
benefit so it means that why would you
do something

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,250
and it gives you less after so it mean

31
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,880
you'd need at minimum a significant
benefit an

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,719
to stick to what really makes a
difference so why would you

33
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,049
they used tool because all the hype
let's say

34
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,209
and rewrite everything in indiana you
get the same results so you should be

35
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:10,899
careful

36
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,970
about what you should to to to use then

37
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,020
the ideal the TOC is bays about problem

38
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,319
I tried to sold across the years and

39
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,129
its many bays on how to tie up

40
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,800
multiple in development project so for
sure when you have just one project to

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,620
install and everything it's easy

42
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,810
at some point you you'll need to
separate and

43
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,550
in some company that could be like a
separate in that case will be more

44
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,069
like the front in stock with the back in
stock but you could can start like

45
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:50,120
sharing components like for web forms
there that obeys or anything you want to

46
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,000
reuse across project and then

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,019
the idea is to have night and
environment where you can

48
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,560
develop dole's multiple projects at the
same time so

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,920
to tie up multiple environments and
tools and to make some development teams

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,230
because at some point when your project
grew

51
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,769
a lot more people involved and probably
more teen

52
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,890
could be a remote teams to so you need
to find a way to mix up

53
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:23,190
all those thing togethers in the same
way so my point of view is to the

54
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,780
separation of concerns

55
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,680
so for sure for each of us concerns
could be different

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,950
could be different like Ace like I said
after adapt to conduct so depending on

57
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,959
the context so

58
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,269
it's a also be used known tools

59
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:41,860
and that's good to create your own staff
but at some point to get stock

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,500
with what you're doing so try to use it
to

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,519
already existed and that people are
beyond those tools so if you need help

62
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,040
or anything

63
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,959
and try to add that to context that
means that the

64
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,080
debt wondering to rule them all is not

65
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,310
a good way to think about things so it's
not because you

66
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,930
developed a way of doing things that way
will be good for everything you'll be

67
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,430
doing

68
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,540
beat sometimes people like

69
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,980
concept and ID's and tools and make
everything fits

70
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,239
in those patterns I think people are
more important than tools

71
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,360
so we should find a way to make the most
out of people

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,080
so what will people

73
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,540
people do if if I die if you die it
means if

74
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,540
I create a lot of thing that I like em i
alone

75
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,520
ed at to work with so if

76
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,270
at some point and no longer part of the
project people will get stock with what

77
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,130
what I've done in the lab to rewrite
everything so when

78
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,860
you mad at something you should be
careful about what you use

79
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,340
and be sure you do thing in the way
people will be able to continue

80
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,180
and work on top of what you've done

81
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,070
so what's the typical workflow for
project

82
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,050
I'm it is is be the thing I don't want
to too much in detailee just like to

83
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,560
understand I do

84
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,250
the the steps so normally you loud like
a server provisioning and set up

85
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,840
you land that web application
development and your lab

86
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,620
the deployment phase

87
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,880
so 42 provisioning and development and
deployment

88
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,660
you need somewhere to run her
application

89
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,650
on so it could be your own machine could
be the developer machine

90
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,669
could be dedicated ard where it could be

91
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,070
any other the awesome man i cum laude

92
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,150
thing we had like line 0 the Rackspace
their work you

93
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,820
an the it could be

94
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,190
the setup manually by someone

95
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,470
or with an orchestration the to like and
symbols I'll stack

96
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,570
doctor in majors it could be provided in
any way

97
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,690
but we should not care

98
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,310
where'd the application will run yes

99
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,740
for deployment that when you develop it
should be your it should not be your

100
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,770
concern

101
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,980
so the should call you

102
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,000
in their process of building there and
there's

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,400
their their setup and their deployment
environment

104
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,900
so they should provide you all the tools
like and that a basin

105
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,150
cashing systemic up in all that up so a
developer could

106
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,970
install I love dad by himself with this
system package if you want to be you

107
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,970
want to you like a virtual machine or
anything

108
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,060
we should not care when we organized the
weed

109
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,360
at environment is done so

110
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,410
the at environment that and should be

111
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:47,400
self-contained as much as possible so

112
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,740
if it still self-contained and

113
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,420
its eventually it will be able to be
around

114
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,020
on multiple platforms environment and
that will provide

115
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,220
a better test than and robbers kobe's

116
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,210
so to bring bad the bagged a concept Bob

117
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,790
up people is I I still think in the team

118
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,220
and tools are not more important than
people so

119
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,700
you won't asked like you're a developer
to use at Vienna because you have

120
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,780
developed a

121
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,420
develop it a lot are there a super
awesome

122
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,580
make ru and then you you want everyone
to use the same setup menu

123
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,560
and Malta the developers use assist and
the

124
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,760
tweak do the way they want to have their
own stop on it

125
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,070
and their database and everything so I
think York

126
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,230
ap environment should not tell them how
to use their own

127
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,070
their own computer and their own we can
do in doing things

128
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,300
and if you want to get the most
out-of-date and you should let them

129
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,180
word in a way there effective so

130
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,620
there with that and development

131
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,610
actually is mostly front-end and
back-end work so

132
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,980
when you back and mostly you're doing
for us

133
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,980
by 10 we're using web frameworks like
pyramid jangle

134
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,420
Laska and we use it 10 template engines
like may call

135
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,510
and ginger to Kenya leon's or ramen

136
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,360
I'll all other libraries and for front
and

137
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,910
the use like HTML CSS JavaScript to use
frameworks to like

138
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,370
angle our backbone the use preprocessor
like a

139
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,360
less sasser copy script a lot of stuff

140
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,390
day they're used to so

141
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,510
both abdulah their own expertise in

142
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,349
tools and network flow so

143
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,270
in some corners the overlaps a some
others

144
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,210
the they are like complimentary just as
an example

145
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,330
and if we look at package management so

146
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,190
under pi don't weir's do so we can do
easy install

147
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,910
or people style packages are a package
with

148
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,900
its own version and for front and they
can do the same

149
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,230
like but were installed jQuery or jQuery

150
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,080
a specific version and in fires like

151
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,030
in require requirement doc the txt or a
set up I we can specify

152
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,390
all the required libraries with their
own version and with the bobber file

153
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,240
edges and finally we can do the same
thing for and then

154
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,830
the front end so what is my were it
simply package manager for to win

155
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,120
actually the problem the problem is a

156
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,850
where is the line the

157
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,280
at the the front end developer will need
like two

158
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,760
to to nope I town and

159
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,920
add is own dependency in item code:

160
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,590
so at some point it make no sense to add
the front end developer

161
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,000
relying on the back and stop so let's
look a bit

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,250
and with asset management so

163
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,280
we can use on the back inside and

164
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,400
with assets in that is a great tools
where you can

165
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,350
the final it's a bundles with those
bundles

166
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,400
you can t find a lot of different fires

167
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,230
you can apply filters to let's say
unified and

168
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,920
cash busting everything and like the
output file

169
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,130
let C pac the GS and then within the
application

170
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,720
or within the template you can refer
Rance and the file

171
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,260
and any tried to the the right to your
own everything so for

172
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,610
back in user it's awesome because it
ease a lot

173
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,620
up things but they have the same or
something similar in the front and world

174
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,040
so

175
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,670
they have their own tools to let's say
min if I

176
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,670
and packages and and then

177
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,870
if you look at adults small snippet so
it loads

178
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,940
and and module granted GS min source:
map and then it register at Ascot and

179
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,110
the task is defined in the country

180
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,720
so you would say they're there's no way
in the back in like to refer Rennes does

181
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,020
your own everything

182
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,710
but that's a bit the point because at
some point to

183
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,990
and you you'll reach sorry

184
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,200
so just to get background like you said
is a task runner

185
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,520
effort to missions so it it's a tool for
them

186
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,520
to help them like to to do a lot

187
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,750
other things we normally do on the back
and sign but

188
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:35,750
for them and then and sorry

189
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,230
okay and I was referring to how we were
for rent

190
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,560
things in there like the application so
in the front signed the

191
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,800
the front at downside the also need away

192
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,980
other including important reply you're a
library's

193
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,420
what we do on the back and sign but at
some point

194
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,390
the need that too because the
application becomes more and more

195
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,320
complicated

196
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,730
so they need a way to load dependencies
to so

197
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,000
if you look at this simple then

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,959
snippet you'll see that you can define a
path for jQuery

199
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,079
for specific library and Dan in their
own code

200
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,550
they can let's say and at Chick worry

201
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,769
and make it avaliable as the dollar
strain

202
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,500
inside that module so why would you want
from tend to rely

203
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,980
a net back and dependency why you'd be
would you want them to know about the

204
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,750
pipe down

205
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,940
so you'll reach appoint

206
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,570
up separation where when the application

207
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,560
is an eye bridge applications so a lot
of stuff is done

208
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,000
on the front end or it's a single page
application

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,190
so in that case your bank back and
becomes like

210
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,270
just an API so it won't make sense

211
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,380
to have does front-end developer relying
on

212
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,410
all the stuff you can do on the back end
so

213
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:06,029
you'll benefit from split into multiple
projects so multiple project could be

214
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:09,079
per team copper concern for so

215
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,370
in that case it means probably back in
stock

216
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,880
and front and stuff so let's say we had
a single page app

217
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,050
so we can add like the back and in a
github repo

218
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,079
the package and the same for the front
end but what we want to use

219
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,350
is to use dole's project under dissing
global

220
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,440
ap or project environment and share a
common set of tools and patterns

221
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,320
so this is where build-out entered the
game

222
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,100
so bill doubted these the

223
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,720
its application centric so ET's the
essentially

224
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,070
and deployment other application
environment and make

225
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,470
that original repeatable process

226
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,750
so build out that he uses extendable
configuration files

227
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,740
so simple like I nighttime it uses
extensions

228
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,800
entity uses received so if you look at
the simple at build-out config file

229
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,399
and you'll see like did at the build-out
part to work I use the extension mister

230
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,270
the blubber

231
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,630
it's an extension like to he's the the
development are

232
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,079
multiple in development projects we can
I like multiple repo

233
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,020
under at the same at a given environment
it extends

234
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,890
a configuration files a on get up don
beyer

235
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,740
Bowl ashrita was kind enough to create
that they're simple the config files

236
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,410
that wraps and like ground and our calm
and

237
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,390
inside your application environment and
then you see I have different parts like

238
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,420
the years eggs and power modules bar
modules in the ritz from day

239
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,180
you men come to your Asian and then
under the flap

240
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,270
this is where I out my multiple
application

241
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,899
so my cap one in my at to and so on

242
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,079
and under D years I am I use a receipt
sorry

243
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:05,760
I use piracy p to create a directory so
let's say

244
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,089
var directory for temperate see

245
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:14,199
things on the format application and
then

246
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,990
the source my at one in my apt to

247
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:23,779
where to get them from and in the egg
part I after receipt be like to in style

248
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,350
like my apt 1 in my apt to that will
abdel

249
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,110
their dependency and I can add other
dependencies just like for the project

250
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,430
so

251
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,819
if I want like to say to add actin like
dat

252
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:39,839
client trap monetary for my application

253
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,680
instead of defining that into my setup
not by:

254
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,660
project it would be a better place to

255
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,060
to have that in the ap environment
configuration

256
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,920
so the idea is to provide

257
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,300
a development project that builds the
application environment so you add

258
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,400
a new project and you don't care about
my apt one in my apt to

259
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,689
and do a gift at Cologne and Ed and do
the people in everything so it's

260
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:12,120
the application environment will take
care up building

261
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,779
everything so basically what you get is

262
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,550
is that so you have a grand final for
different tasks

263
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,420
so we'll probably have to make final
I'll tell you that the

264
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,079
more about after you out like the
bootstrap that PI what

265
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,949
P wife I'll that that used to bootstrap
the build-up environment

266
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,980
so the byword for the Bauer dependencies
your javascript dependencies

267
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,279
and the build-out configuration probably
and the TC directories for your

268
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,880
application

269
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,100
configuration and the package judges and
it's for the node

270
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,720
module package management

271
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,480
to install its a grant and power and
other

272
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,050
required libraries then to set up the
project

273
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,029
allowed like to clone that the
environment project

274
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:05,650
then see the rapper do every trial and
the

275
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,640
and then round bootstrap bootstrap will
boo troubled out and then around build

276
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,209
out and build out we'll take care

277
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,620
against ollie everything you need for
your application

278
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,809
then you're done so people can start
working on your project

279
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,640
white make sense it's because I don't
think you need to provide a full stack

280
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,750
environment with

281
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,890
all the server components under virtual
machine

282
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:35,220
or an image or anything yet 4 developing
an application for deployment yes but

283
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,980
for

284
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,980
for development it's a bit different I
think so

285
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,179
it will look a bit like that so once you
and start the application you get

286
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:47,620
all the same fines plus other ones like
that the bean

287
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,909
dead include done by the virtual and and
the ex done by then

288
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:57,200
build-out configuration and you get done
or more jewels and the components

289
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,330
for by our and that no modules

290
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,750
then and another temp simple way to

291
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,690
to rap das comments and in in the easier
way

292
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,700
would be to use let's say to make file
just around those comp come and

293
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,800
under and a common API so from in people

294
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,080
don't care like to to know about it I
can't comment and probably put it back

295
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,919
in people

296
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,240
don't care about knowing the front
uncommon so you can probably create like

297
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,220
a makefile

298
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,570
where your app how we prayed the virtual
and

299
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,480
how you bootstrapper build-out how your
own build-out

300
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,110
and add a comment: set-top that runs all
those common

301
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,390
so indie and let's say your front end
developer to get started the project

302
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,010
will just how I like to clone your
project and then see the app and

303
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:53,130
make setup everything will be done and
then you could add other common like

304
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,700
make run that happened that will do like
it P survey

305
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,870
your your a knife i in and around the
web server

306
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,870
and when you separate project so let's
say you have

307
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,980
the front and total these stand-alone

308
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,659
so ground provide

309
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:13,059
a small web server for them to develop
so there's no need for Dan to Ron

310
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:16,450
your heightened code to test and
organize their thing

311
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,200
but at some point it would be important
like to run the back and

312
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,570
or anything so both project can coexist

313
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,059
under the same at environment so in fact

314
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:31,200
the goal is to isolate application
environment

315
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,220
it's too organize projects in this
flexible way

316
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,039
and give more power to users anti so

317
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,409
many questions perhaps

318
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:51,639
anyone has a question

319
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:56,109
and his microphone over there for asking
questions on

320
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:59,659
I guess no questions so on

321
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:03,799
thank you very much up the time we're
not getting there is a question

322
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:10,799
I was gonna ask you afterwards but

323
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:18,749
guessing that's good for everybody here
on buildup is pretty cool but what

324
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,080
happens when you have

325
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,830
repositories that depend upon other
repositories which themselves have their

326
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,739
own set ups

327
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:29,259
which are arbitrarily complex you're
probably would like to some module I

328
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:30,049
would get up

329
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:34,399
you needed a to get some modules are not
get some Marshall some

330
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,220
I've been burned by up on water twice
already ok arm

331
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,340
actual separate git repositories that
your core project if you

332
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,499
split something out into multiple get
repost transport some reason

333
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:50,879
and I that Model A and model be our
separate get repose

334
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:54,499
yet and how would you use build-out
actually check all that stuff out and

335
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:55,269
set up both

336
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:58,659
environments and partly because they
have overlapping requirements but not

337
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,570
completely overlapping requirements

338
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,590
well then I mean for

339
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:09,769
multiple project under the same and
application environment would probably

340
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,769
means you need

341
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,139
you need the same set so if you develop
like tree different module

342
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:18,429
who believe need the same virtual and

343
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:21,599
and everything so it's not different
let's say

344
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,200
it's not multiple literal and inside the
same application environments Chris but

345
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,099
you need the same requirements for all
those modules

346
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:33,759
but at least mister developer as an
extension lets you have comments 2

347
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,629
to all dole's then check out and
everything

348
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,769
under Dan the application environment

349
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:45,749
but it won't create different virtual
and for does different projects

350
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:49,570
actually that's actually good that's
exactly what I would want to duplicate

351
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:56,399
thank you okay

352
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:59,909
that's given make plays hand then

353
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:05,739
20 you way
