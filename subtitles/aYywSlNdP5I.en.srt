00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,760
hello everyone and welcome to the third
session in our security track

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,549
and I am happy to present young leave
who will be talking to us about

3
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,039
multi-factor authentication and
possession factors

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,509
be hand for young players I

5
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:26,759
so

6
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:31,099
hi my name is yang I work at Rackspace
am NOT on authentication

7
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:35,130
but thank you all for coming despite
that I know the sock is supposed to be

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,829
about multi-factor authentication

9
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:41,600
I'm actually going to go slightly off
script and answered I'm just gonna tell

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,930
you a story about two people named Alice
and Bob

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,660
bob is a gamer he really likes playing
games

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,170
so he built his own an enema MMO called
world to Bob Kraft

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,579
it became incredibly popular so much so
that in game items

14
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,730
and gold became worth real money on the
open market so

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,589
ceiling counts became a very profitable
business one day

16
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:07,310
Alice a long time only player with lots
of high-level items and gold

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,230
reporter or regular I don't have been
liquidated her gold stolen by someone

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,470
who hijacked a recount

19
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,340
bob has to spend all they verify her
story and restoring her counts and

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,140
possessions

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,540
every day more and more players are
reporting their accounts to one

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,490
Bob spends all his time restoring
accounts rather than making new content

23
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,880
which makes bob sad he read about how
companies like get her Google Facebook

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,770
and Blizzard at a two-factor
authentication to their services to

25
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,070
increase account security

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,530
the seem to involve asking for two
things are like an insider one

27
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,230
Sabah that the second password
requirement to the world a bobcat login

28
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,680
and account discontinue and Bob
continues being sad

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,020
why what did I do wrong well
multi-factor authentication doesn't mean

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,070
just asking for any two things are like
in

31
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,390
it requires at least two different
factors which

32
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,050
are something you know such as a
password or PIN something you have such

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,550
as an ATM card phone or are set again

34
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,890
and something you are meeting something
inherent you such as your fingerprints

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,020
are your rental pattern

36
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,060
to the same factors like bugs to require
passwords don't count

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,250
the reason they don't count is that
using multiple passwords is like putting

38
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,819
a secret but say the account data you
want to protect

39
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,109
inside a box which represents a password

40
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,409
and ap ok

41
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:32,409
more compact around 10 for her

42
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,829
the point to this completely legitimate
and legal fair use of copyrighted

43
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,010
material

44
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,849
is that where's the boxes do not protect
against an attacker who can't open

45
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:44,150
even a single box because they can do
the same to all the boxes

46
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,299
for instance a keylogger was still any
number password as easily is all still

47
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:48,790
one

48
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,370
without any further cost the attacker
multi-factor of is like placing a

49
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,239
security guard in front of your box

50
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,640
an attacker has to be a to both get
around the security guard and opened the

51
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,200
box

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,810
even if they still in the key to the box
from you your password in this analogy

53
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,969
they don't automatically get past the
security guard without having to do more

54
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:06,590
work

55
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,340
each type a factor has a difference had
a vulnerability is our weaknesses that

56
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,499
an attacker like this

57
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:16,560
can use a break in it's important to
consider with this attackers going to do

58
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,510
and how your defense will prevent
against that rather than just throwing

59
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,609
up defenses willy nilly with apt

60
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:26,549
them actually doing anything stress in
some attacks against password

61
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,909
authentication include man in the middle
attacks

62
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,760
when attackers sits between Alice and
Bob and pretend he's bout hours and

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,400
contends he's asked Bob and reason
perhaps modifies traffic that tells you

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,989
something to Bob or vice versa

65
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,010
password authentication is also
vulnerable to phishing attacks

66
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,370
where an attacker tries to trick us into
giving her password

67
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,269
cute keep key logging attacks were an
attack a lot of the key threats analysis

68
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:50,290
machine

69
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,529
and replay one attacker may not be able
to read traffic

70
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:57,269
but he can copy traffic from oust about
without being and understand or modify

71
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,370
and replace the traffic back to bob at a
later point while pretending to be Alice

72
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,689
possession factors are also vulnerable
to men in the military

73
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:09,239
axe and they can be physically stolen
and then the attacker would be in

74
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,409
possession analysis possession factor

75
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:15,040
various types the possession factors
also have their own weaknesses but these

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,410
are the general attacks against

77
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,180
opposition factors without going into
specifics biometric factors like

78
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,140
fingerprints can also be stolen

79
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,320
people leave them everywhere son
attacker can easily obtain them

80
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,390
since fingerprints to change the
credentials can never be revoked

81
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,040
and they're vulnerable to replay attacks
but the stock is just gonna discuss two

82
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,190
factor authentication

83
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,960
to FA if you ever see this acronym are
using knowledge and possession factors

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,770
because this is currently the most
common combination

85
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,240
went to factor are combined the attacks
against a factor of

86
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,850
is the intersection against one factor
and the attacks against the other

87
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,340
so an attack that works only against one
factor is insufficient to compromise

88
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,410
like an

89
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,860
if an attacker keylogger else's password
login is a protected by the token factor

90
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,130
and the way most possession factors work
is that they produce a one-time password

91
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,300
which can only be used once so even if
an attacker gets alice is complete login

92
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,580
by which I mean password

93
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,100
and Pat a RTP they can't use the token

94
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,330
led by as if the possession factor
stolen the law gonna so protected by the

95
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,460
password

96
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,560
the goal is to minimize this
intersection of attacks and that's why

97
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,620
bob has to include at least two factors

98
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,100
at the same factor say two passwords it
is used twice

99
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,320
the intersection of attacks the same as
that for single factor password

100
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,650
authentication

101
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,490
it just because two factors are used
doesn't mean that the intersection is a

102
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,740
smart it could be

103
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,790
after provides after Kan's likable
authenticator of the annual security

104
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,710
can run on phones and make it really
easy for our cities multi-factor

105
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,550
authentication without having to buy a
heart again

106
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,100
the phones are general-purpose computing
devices meaning they can be exploited

107
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,290
meaning the token and password can be
compromised at the same time

108
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,170
so this intersection becomes this

109
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,160
I'm when using a softer going on to
found the intersection contains another

110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,480
attack which is exploit the fun

111
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,310
as you can see there still fewer attacks
than in single factor password

112
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,420
authentication

113
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,890
so it's not that Allah should not use of
tokens on a fun it's that she should be

114
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,210
aware the other attack

115
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,250
and take extra care the security on her
son

116
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,970
so now knowing what multi-factor
authentication is Bob surveys other

117
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,270
sites that provide it

118
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,630
and find the most commonly supported
possession factors

119
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,000
these possession factor operatives
tokens that are one-time passwords

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,910
meaning they X expire after beef time
expire after single-use

121
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,380
or both the most common tokens on
smartphones

122
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,640
which are supported by the previously
mentioned aP's are open authentication

123
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,910
time-based one-time password steer
teepees

124
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,510
which usually expire after about 30
seconds this is 08 %eh not

125
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,470
of this is authentication our office for
authorization

126
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,340
which I know is super clear

127
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,390
2tb again time this one-time passwords
require shared secret between the client

128
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,290
and server

129
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,230
and are generated using the secret and
the current time the TOTP generated by

130
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,600
Alice's ap is valid

131
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,840
if it matches the TAT be generated by
world Bob Kraft

132
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,130
algorithms pressure in simple
unspecified and those are sees

133
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,860
and there are many people either is that
support it for instance cryptography not

134
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,850
only supports it that many other
cryptographic capabilities

135
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,400
OOTP of just supports 28 th and but also
includes a nice example how to generate

136
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,550
a QR code

137
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,580
am from the shared secret so that you
can communicate the shared secret to

138
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,710
your user

139
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,380
many sites also support SMS based
one-time passwords about

140
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,000
be would text else around MOT p and she
must provide a back

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,900
this works even if else doesn't have a
smartphone

142
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,640
clear provides a REST API that can let
bob send nm as a nest Alice

143
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,620
allowing him to support SMS based
authentication an HTTP client can be

144
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,020
years but will they also provides an
expert on Trulia client

145
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,140
a commonly supported consume her talking
to the you keep

146
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,800
which acts as a USB keyboard ass just
has to plug it in

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,350
press the button and a generator no TP
based on a counter

148
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,370
you go provides validation service as
well as an open source validation

149
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,230
servers so that I can write once run one
on his own rather than depend on you the

150
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,250
cap

151
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,850
there are quite a few Python client
libraries that support access to the

152
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,070
validation API

153
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,740
I'm the first one is the official one
second one is the one that will be using

154
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,720
examples because typing a shorter

155
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,930
okay so what does bob need to do to
support possession factors

156
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,729
he has till et al sad factors her
account yes to validate the factor when

157
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,060
I was logged in

158
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,079
and his lapels remove factors from her
account

159
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:42,990
but the years out the general pattern
tattoo factor of from scratch to a

160
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,550
general pipe an application

161
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,899
which also placed at using frameworks
such as flask and twisted

162
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,670
the Nexus lies are going to assume
year's model that looks something like

163
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,709
this:

164
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,410
it has a collection of possession
factors in order of preference in Dallas

165
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,889
because bob would like to support backup
devices in case Alice loses her

166
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,189
preferred device

167
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:05,189
which would be the first at factor in
the collection

168
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:08,870
all bob's factors will have this
interface arm

169
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,310
has a function to check whether no TB is
Alan a start

170
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,660
because some factors require set up
before every 0 TP

171
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,910
a start function that does the third set
up and a prop the prompt is for later

172
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,879
when bob has to ask alice furlaud TP

173
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,170
so first we're gonna cover TRT peace

174
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,490
the flow is that bob generates a shared
secret communicate the shared secret be

175
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,540
at two alisya QR code

176
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,199
and then one else wants to authenticate
using this factor XII generator TOTP

177
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,790
from the shared secret

178
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,199
which she gets back to bob and bob has
to match against the TTP that he

179
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,970
produces from the shared secret

180
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,439
for the fact occurred and Bob generates
a random Jersey good

181
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:51,860
and he's though to be of library to
check the validity of the test other

182
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,749
RTP given the secret there's no setup
except on first configuring the factors

183
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:59,189
so the start function does nothing

184
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:02,870
to configure the factor Bob send a cure
can like the diagrams as

185
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,050
with her response and if the token
checks out by being at the factored her

186
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,279
account

187
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,600
and they get user input function here is
synchronous

188
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,300
and is also not implemented in the slut
entered imported from the made-up module

189
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,629
for weather maps the QR code and a form
would have to be rendered on appears so

190
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:23,029
in reality asking the user for their TP
is probably a synchronous stateful and

191
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,589
much more complex

192
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:29,139
speaking if your records this is the
general form at the right to be included

193
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:30,470
in the Cure occurred

194
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,980
and its best by the other them use the
issuer and the username

195
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,029
because else that may be generating 30
piece from multiple services

196
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:41,199
this helps apt label which took emblems
the world Bob Kraft

197
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:45,259
and which took emblems the world Carol
craft

198
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:50,110
OOTP of generates this year I when given
the relevant information services what

199
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,490
the generate QR code function looks like

200
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,100
for the SMS factor bobby is truly a to
send SMS's

201
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,829
and the way SMS tokens work is that
Allah's give up her phone number

202
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,569
but generate some random token text the
towers at that number

203
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:11,850
and the token that I ask is back to bob
has to match what Bob texted her

204
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,160
bob for sneezing accounts really oh so
that he can provide his account ID and

205
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,860
are talking to the rest clients

206
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,259
and he also needs a toy a number you can
send us a message from

207
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:23,379
because the start function stores the
generated 0 TP

208
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:27,629
Texas hours at the number she gave them
from Bob's number registered with

209
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:29,079
William

210
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,600
validating the ATP is just checking that
matches the store 21

211
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,170
and this is a night implementation that
doesn't take into account sending Alice

212
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,209
multiple tokens token expiry

213
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:43,110
or API failures but this is the general
idea

214
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,120
and there's one extra check in this ad
factor function

215
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,740
the configuration only continues if the
phone number has not already been to fit

216
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,170
configured for Alice

217
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,309
it's already on our asses account at
Bill's that if it is then this

218
00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:00,050
then proceed like the diagram Bob text
Alice ask is back about 30 p.m.

219
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,930
the phone numbers at Alice's account as
a possession packed

220
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,509
so now for the you key factor and before
you begin it's good to know that every

221
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,360
time the UB key button has passed

222
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,930
and OOTP is produced that has the idea
the you keep which never changes

223
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,699
concatenated to the actual 0 TP part
which changes every time and is exactly

224
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:21,220
thirty two characters

225
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,069
said to get the ID you just chomp of
their last 32 characters at the Ukiah TP

226
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:31,930
so whenever Allah's provides an ATP Bob
checks in with you because servers

227
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,149
an extract also extract the idea the UK
which is that cookie looking thing

228
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:40,709
am I D matches the one that hours
previously registered in

229
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,800
then alice is using the same you be key
issued registered

230
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,800
and if you go also says that about 30 P
then

231
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,980
yea alice is authenticated

232
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,600
to validate against you care about has
generated a client ID and secret magic

233
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,240
key for all the Bob Kraft

234
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,540
the keys used by you Curtis I and the
responses to the partners

235
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,869
responses from you cannot spooked by an
attacker

236
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:06,999
let the 2:30 p.m. the start function
does nothing cuz there's no setup

237
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,730
the checker TP kar dan just as with the
diagram am

238
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,869
described it validates 30 P and the
client validates the signature

239
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:18,029
extract the Bahia de cheques it against
the store and I D

240
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,110
and again this is a simplified
implementation does not take into

241
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,529
account

242
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:26,689
API failures and what happens if their
signature failures

243
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:31,749
when adding a Yuki else needs to provide
30 p.m. and if the factor that the

244
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:35,160
with that particular you be here I D
hasn't been configured already

245
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,589
and RTP validates the Bob can add that
you pick your ID

246
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,369
as a factor for her account

247
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:46,050
soon after validating a token I log in
despite a simpler because most the work

248
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,629
was already done in the factor
obstructions which is what made the

249
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,379
previous part time are complex and
lengthy

250
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:55,910
am the logic is that Alice gives bob her
username and password

251
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,439
Bob checks that the user exists that the
password checks out

252
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,029
sees a palace has a second factor
configured and if so he asked Allah's

253
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,970
for the second factor credentials

254
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,129
arm then Alice gives those credentials
back to bob

255
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:12,040
and Bob validates those credentials

256
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,629
hear about stop-start start off with a
leg infection which checks the user

257
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:20,350
the password in the possession factor on
bob also made it take a post login

258
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,439
argument which is a callable that
executes post login logic

259
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:26,819
am will see why in a sec

260
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:29,850
checking the possession factor just
means that bob sees when Alice has at

261
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,639
least one configured possession factor

262
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,910
as though he asks for the RTP validated
using the preferred factor which is the

263
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,660
first factor in the collection

264
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,279
if everything's good postal outpost
login logic executes

265
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,569
I remember how each factor has a start
function for set up an impromptu asked

266
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:45,990
for these are stoking

267
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,290
it speaks so that this function could be
factor independent rather than giant

268
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:49,779
nested

269
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,800
Elstree

270
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,579
to spur backup devices but asks for both
the type a factor and the token

271
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,050
the default factor would of course be
the preferred factor but ass can pick a

272
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,959
different factor

273
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,929
on her back to factors if the ticket is
validated the talking is validated

274
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:08,339
no matter what but if the factor she
picked as a backup factor

275
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,889
then email sent to her warning her that
a backup factor not her preferred

276
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,029
accuracy is

277
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:18,129
because the should be an unusual
occurrence and might be an attacker

278
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:21,619
so now is perfect for its actions and
login implementation established

279
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:25,860
revocation is even simpler there's not
even a diagram

280
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,660
removing a factor is just a leading from
the collection but since this could be

281
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,980
an attacker trying to decrease account
security

282
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,569
a warning email should be centel's any
time factors removed

283
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,389
even better would be if I privilege
functionality like this would require

284
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,199
Alice to log in again

285
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,290
I remember how to login function took a
purse login

286
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,249
callable so up for a more secure remove
factor function

287
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:53,529
and back our book can be the non suited
remove factor function

288
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:56,819
sup that was adding to factor out from
scratch due to application the full code

289
00:15:56,819 --> 00:16:00,050
is up I'm I get a beeper 30 run as a
little command line demo

290
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,209
the made-up module is actually
implemented

291
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:08,050
for something more flask specific the
200 block has a very nice example had

292
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,999
TOTP is an SMS factors

293
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:15,110
to a flask ap but certain parts are
ruled by Kraft use Django

294
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,869
and there's anger middleware that
handles to factor of free in

295
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:23,149
where the most complete plugins as
Django TP it's a framework that provides

296
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,100
support for all the previously mentioned
authentication methods

297
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,989
although trillion you be key supporter
separate plugins on that has models for

298
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,050
the devices

299
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,339
and it updates the user model to include
whether two factor authentication is

300
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:35,809
enabled

301
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:40,059
all you need to do is install them and
at the middle classes and install the

302
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:40,910
app's to

303
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,230
a dang good on tap Settings tab by

304
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,679
there's another project gender to factor
of which integrates tango TP

305
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,579
into jaggers built an authentication
framework and makes it really easy to

306
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,709
pass the login here to be a multi-factor
like nvm

307
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,999
and there's no US support for Yuki
devices yet but there's a park or if

308
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:03,189
there's an issue out for that

309
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,339
Bob just add some more install the app's
an 11-year-old to Settings app I

310
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:10,819
along with his credentials First Folio
account

311
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,339
and yet the two-factor your own route as
the login routes

312
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,100
and alice when logged and can now enable
to factor authentication

313
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,709
and configure her preferred list at her
preferred factor

314
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,760
if the configuration floods went by
really quickly don't worry I'm the docs

315
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,730
for Django TB describe the installation
and configuration

316
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,480
in detail more than the slides do

317
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,120
and Django to factor of has just as
extensive darts and also comes with a

318
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,549
nice

319
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,460
example Django out that demonstrate its
use which is where the PB screen shots

320
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,330
came from

321
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,559
example app is available to train line
and of course Bob Rowe dollars own views

322
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,700
and themed everything for world but Bob
Kraft but I gave them a good idea what

323
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,769
to do

324
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:55,140
but could also have used a device like
to the security or of the which would

325
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,490
handle

326
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,049
else the second factor completely Bob
just has to register with the device

327
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:05,360
and let them know about Alice and the
service does all these things about how

328
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,169
to do before about stuff

329
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,860
house has to register her devices with
the service and cerebral the Bob Kraft

330
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,929
but then when she logs and Bob validates
your password

331
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:17,190
the service handles her second factor

332
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,110
so now authentication is secure and bob
is happily ever after creating content

333
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,730
Alice never loses control for a dungeon
loot again rates

334
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,179
well there's other ways for them to be
needing a player to world the Bob Kraft

335
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,990
not just log in and login has been
protected by Bob using multi-factor

336
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,799
authentication

337
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,840
but not every request made world by
Kraft requires a password and token

338
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,039
an attacker CSO an attacker can use some
other form other than to cation

339
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,809
for instance after login world bypasses
the session key for Alice to

340
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,340
authenticate ran subsequent requests

341
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,559
until she lives outs an attacker who
eavesdrops the ski

342
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,210
then has a full access to Alice's
account

343
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,419
is dropping can be mitigated using TLS
also known as SSL

344
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:04,210
I'm sorry to encrypt all traffic however
include to traffic won't help with alice

345
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,460
is man in the middle with an attack who
pretends to be well the Bob Kraft

346
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,269
so but has to provide a valid till
certificate and house is quiet must

347
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:12,190
verify it

348
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,230
very important in order to mitigate the
threat at the man and millet ac

349
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,309
but as we've seen from this year
learning from a Nextag

350
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:23,390
earlier on TLS um libraries that provide
tailored support can have on our

351
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,250
abilities

352
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,620
summer which negate the point of using
it in the first place so both Alstom Bob

353
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,230
have to respond immediately to any
required patching up the last libraries

354
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,730
and keep everything up today okay

355
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:41,080
something else is vulnerable to man in
the middle attacks and is not anymore

356
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,919
another tether that occasion is API keys
access tokens

357
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,929
such as of: not 08 %eh this time

358
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:50,570
for applications that need to
authenticate in the background without

359
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,360
any interaction with the user

360
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,039
for instance the world a bobcat mobile
app which allows als checker auctions

361
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,309
and in game mail

362
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,590
but make sure that every app has to
request a different API key

363
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,809
so they're all revoke a bowl and
auditable independently of each other

364
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:11,320
and he also limit how much access each
API key has given it only as much

365
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,580
privilege as it needs

366
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,340
so that an attacker who stormed hours as
mobile API key doesn't have full access

367
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,559
to our account

368
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,159
but makes use agenda ATP's go to be
required decorated which behaves like

369
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,929
anchors log in required decorator

370
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,169
that requires that these are have to be
logged in using multi-factor

371
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:34,100
of I'm potentially dangerous changes
like changing passwords token factors

372
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,809
are emails

373
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:38,440
can compromise the security on account
so changes like these would be good

374
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,970
candidates for acquiring

375
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,720
that these are be logged in with not a
factor of even better would be to

376
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,070
require hours to provide credentials
again

377
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,220
as you would for if you are executing
pseudo commands at all such dangers

378
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,210
actions

379
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,690
should result in a warning email being
sent Alice in case they're taken by an

380
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,240
attacker and not her

381
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,200
and Alice much more careful now because
our account had been stolen

382
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,389
his careful attention to these emails
even though they might seem annoying are

383
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:05,559
kinda spendy

384
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:09,210
by doing all these things bob protect
access to Alice's account as much as

385
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:09,779
possible

386
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,529
while keeping usability is a back says
hi

387
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:17,019
as mentioned before world Bob Kraft
provide the recovery mechanism in case

388
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:18,570
else has to change her credentials

389
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,399
account recovery is just log in again
anyone who recovers an account is just

390
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:25,279
resetting the account credentials

391
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,570
recovery should be audible and rear all
such changes should be live so that

392
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,590
malicious attempts to reset credentials
can be identified

393
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,620
and research should be difficult at
least as much as regular login or all

394
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,919
attackers will just go after the lowest
hanging fruit which is account reset

395
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,860
which is why Bob keeps obsessing over
this

396
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,090
so bob has provided backup devices so
that asking is a backup to open to login

397
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,590
and is in disable the primary token
which

398
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,350
is supported by Django to factor of but
bob could have also emailed

399
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,720
hours with the reset link forcing hours
to prove that she's in possession of the

400
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,539
email account associated with her

401
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:06,169
account arm this is a standard mechanism
that services with only single factor of

402
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:07,830
provide to reset passwords

403
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,299
but even services with multi-factor of
fall back on this if the user doesn't

404
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,769
have backup device is configured

405
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:17,049
unfortunately emails negated by
multi-factor arts so it turns into

406
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:17,690
something

407
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,880
you know something you know that bob
started with so

408
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,210
what has Elliston alice is set up to
factor of for all the Bob Kraft

409
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,899
she set up backup factors that she
doesn't have to resort to in our set

410
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:34,590
she's chosen different strong passwords
for both world by Kraft and her email

411
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,490
account

412
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,710
and she set up to factor of other e-mail
too because she really wants to receive

413
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,029
those warning emails

414
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:44,139
and gary said he knows I'm she's careful
about what he does your phone

415
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:47,260
she set up a lock screen and promote
white so that she could keep her soft

416
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,309
open safe

417
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:51,580
and she keeps our systems up to date so
that any vulnerabilities can be passed

418
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,179
as soon as possible

419
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:55,909
she has not had any more incidents of
account that and is now the highest

420
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:59,519
level was its neighbor and while the Bob
Kraft

421
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,760
bob is implemented in saree promoting
multi-factor of two of his players

422
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,730
you provide secure and auditable
recovery options includes all traffic

423
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,370
and limits privileges have less secure
forms authentication

424
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,179
I'm he keeps all the crew to libraries
needed to provide said security up to

425
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:16,019
date

426
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,299
and now account that is down world Bob
Kraft not gone because not all players

427
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,179
are careful analysis

428
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:29,179
um but he spends much higher percentage
of the time designing contents

429
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:37,000
sorry it's not moving

430
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,429
ok whenever so and they both lived
happily

431
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:48,429
and it visually ever after thanks for
coming everyone

432
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,990
thank you so much game arm we don't have
time for questions right now

433
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,919
but there is space out for a hallway
bomb if you would like to ask you any

434
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,230
questions about her presentation

435
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,519
we are now taking a break for a few
minutes

436
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,909
please feel free to go down there is
still some swag laughed

437
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:13,610
in the exposition hall with all the
sponsors please check them out

438
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,860
and give them a moment of your time
thank you

439
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,210
story
