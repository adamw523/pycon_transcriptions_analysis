1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,529
so this will be last talk for the day is
going to be a talk called

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,859
Python plus geographic data because to
be a bus

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,980
please give a hand for Miley sacks Ben
Burnett

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,980
there is this fabulous bitly link to my
talk

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,170
and including everything that I'm not
going to have time to say in markdown

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:23,880
format

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,210
cell there's that for your reference
thank you for hanging out till the end

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,900
of the day

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,179
and I'm really excited to share this
with you

10
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:36,380
so why do a thing Python and geographic
area gonna be best friends forever

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,270
well I love maps but making them can be
a real pain

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,180
and it the reason is wild card harper's
don't just trace stuff anymore you have

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,160
to deal with

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,320
the dear and an

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,500
that can be really really really awful
it is usually not in the format that you

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,160
need there's like a hundred different
formats at least

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,809
several obvious errors everyone with
sinbad data has created their own now

18
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,519
island at some point

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,900
split up into fifty different files from

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,119
and is definitely in the wrong
protection so on

21
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,630
sometimes you even have no metadata so
you don't know what protection it in one

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,920
including its then

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,950
it can be pretty awful cell you can
point and click all day and you're outta

24
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,590
the box yes software

25
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,920
or you can bring Python it to the max

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,509
so a little bit about vector geo data

27
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,119
and before we get started it can be made
up of one or several files

28
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,680
it will have a cordon it's a steamer
production associated with it to show

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,369
held their ground earth ends up on a
flat surface

30
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:49,240
and it can be made up the one or several
layers have data

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,159
each of which has one or more features
and each feature has to have geometry

32
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,610
and that includes both the type so
whether it's a point line polygon

33
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,439
and of course its accordance themselves
and then

34
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,310
each feature also has berries other
attributes and properties these vary

35
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,020
widely depending on the data

36
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,590
so now we can talk about some my
favorite paper on packages to use to

37
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,890
deal with this problem

38
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,120
of the owners the first one that I
really like him

39
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,150
and what can be an

40
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,290
really awesome when you're making a map
there's great free data all over the

41
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,160
place national earth is a great place to
you

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,950
get and simplify made world

43
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,599
data and country is nice nice car to
graphically

44
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,030
mind out and a lot of interesting
attributes but it's usually not

45
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,420
in a format that I like cell but say we
wanna change it to dr. Jason

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,440
so after you download your data

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,810
you just create a really short sketch
and with Fianna

48
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,890
you can open it up it automatically
figures out what it means in the open

49
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,670
part but then when you open up your

50
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,569
output file you need to tell okay which
coordinate system agony use what's the

51
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,120
schema so that includes a geometry and
the attributes

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,370
on and what do you want to turn it into
you so here we're saying we just want to

53
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,209
use the same

54
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,340
as the input for the corner system and

55
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,360
the schema and but we want to change it
to GA Jason

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,440
and then for each feature in that
original file we go through it one by

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,739
one and say okay

58
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:30,440
the sizes on Antarctica let's keep it
and you can also filter by bounding box

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,220
if you want

60
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,129
the eastern hemisphere Western
Hemisphere much smaller or bigger than

61
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:34,599
that

62
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,470
you can do that really is Lee with your
own as well yea data

63
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:45,840
another great Python packages pipe
wrench so say you I am

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,900
projections can be a problem that last
one

65
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,239
actually not super pretty especially at
the top and bottom and

66
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,010
at the polls there an if you're tracing
great circle routes

67
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,670
if you are and making a map at the polls
you definitely need to use an

68
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,069
appropriate protection

69
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,720
and pay pride works really well with the
honor to do that so in this example

70
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,639
we are gonna go ahead and polling in the
schema from the original file

71
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,430
but then it take the coordinate system
and put it into production

72
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,949
object and then after we open it up

73
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:27,199
the new one and say okay I wanna get

74
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,000
I want it to be in projection 2163
that's a code any PSG code you can with

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,560
peace out these are well-known codes
felt kinda different productions

76
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,570
and then get ready to go and by putting
the output protection

77
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,780
in a projection and while

78
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,440
this is work it's kind of weird on
natural earth data and some other is

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,860
polygon something that's multi polygons
a multi polygon is kinda higher level

80
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,250
they can contain a number poly irons

81
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,860
South in either those cases you need to
treat it a little differently cuz the

82
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,139
corn its themselves will live one level

83
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,229
deeper so depending on whether it's a
polygon arm of the polygon

84
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:13,210
you use the yeah you you can a stack it
up a little differently but in either

85
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,680
case you used chance form which is fun
pipe Raj

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,770
to change every single core net one by
one

87
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,070
from the input production to the output
production

88
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,509
and then you can get something like this
spree awesome

89
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:33,660
one last year an example so I am a real
I'm quantified self

90
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,449
ke Kai & Bike Wear fit bid at Taconic
like Ryan's

91
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:40,870
I've never bothered to visualize the
mall in a map before

92
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,090
which is kinda silly colette make maps
all time

93
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,300
I'm one of the biggest problems is that
have all the separate tracks in out

94
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,020
download the all separately

95
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,220
and I just wanna do it once it on do it
over and over and over again

96
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,150
sell this example takes a whole bunch a
GPX tracks puts them in a single file

97
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,660
makes a lot easier to map and

98
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,569
so here what I do is a gravel one
example file

99
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,669
and grab décor nitsa stem in the schema

100
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:12,319
from that and then I said that your
normal kinda directory walking

101
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,440
operation pull everything that ends in
dot GP axe

102
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,819
and read through it an at it to you this
final file

103
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,940
so that I'm able to make appeals Asian
like this where I find out that I really

104
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,220
don't do much but go back and forth to
work all the time

105
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,130
and but that's okay I'm but before we go
any further let's talk a little bit

106
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,139
about your Jason to why do I keep
turning everything in GH a sign

107
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:43,030
it is Jason for geo data it's super easy
to use for web app being when adding

108
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,220
libraries and early love it

109
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,400
and it's really easy to perceive Python
because really it's

110
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,910
just dictionary

111
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,139
so here's kind im a weird example add to
talk that OpenStreetMap because

112
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,539
I'm on the board I love it an
OpenStreetMap is great because

113
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:07,130
it's a lot of free data proud source
that you can get from all over the world

114
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,590
they can be really hard to find a
scanner data anywhere else

115
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,330
on but the data structures really weird

116
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,039
and you get everything all at once so
what's am planning a trip to Japan which

117
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,120
I usually am planning 1 1 I'm going and
I

118
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,020
an and I wanna check out all the
buildings in this area them interested

119
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,970
in

120
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,080
you can just download them from the
OpenStreetMap website

121
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,110
but you're gonna get everything all all
that you can get streets you can get

122
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,120
to still you know the country of Japan
you can get all this by selecting a

123
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,639
scary it's kinda crazy

124
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,120
I N there are a number of ways to
convert it over to GH a sign

125
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,110
on but really it's just XML data see you
can dig into it with your favorite XML

126
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,650
parser

127
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,229
if you like it's while and then process
it so

128
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,569
the reason why I love JJ sign and why
pick this example

129
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:03,090
is you can just play with the dating
keep exactly what you want you don't

130
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,099
want you have to use

131
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:07,120
anyway I resolve really iron

132
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,879
you just load it up by using Jason lutes

133
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,840
I'm here we're creating a feature
collection dictionary that is going to

134
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,849
be valid year Jason when it's all done

135
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:22,660
and then we're going to loop through all
I'll features in that dataset

136
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,199
Shack all the tags in it to the way
OpenStreetMap

137
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,590
represented attributes is by

138
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,250
having tags for everything cell a
building with the name

139
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,700
is can have been building tag with some
value and a name tag

140
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,550
some value seldom I say that that's what
I want it so I check if theres

141
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,580
building Mary if there's name in there

142
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,950
let's go ahead and move on style

143
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:53,050
then we're gonna grab the ID pulled the
name out of the tags

144
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,180
grab all the other information we need

145
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,870
and then create on with those variables

146
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,110
the final Goga sign version that we want
cell

147
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,649
you put the geometry revlon's the
corners where they belong

148
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,120
keep name outside of tags and keep all
the other random tags

149
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,510
in this separate tactic sherry and go
ahead and add it to our final file

150
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,570
and all you need to do to create that
final Jason file then

151
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,100
is do jason Thompson then you can get
cool stuff like this

152
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,500
and he's all the buildings are at
Shinjuku I am but I shoulda got the

153
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,850
ramen shops instead

154
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,300
that's what I really care about now you
can also do some more operation with CSV

155
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,269
or XML data to you all you need to do is
put it in a dictionary

156
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:42,870
and then put your duties on together so
I do this when

157
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,019
organza datasets from all over the place

158
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,500
an and unable to make it so at the end

159
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,800
and only the features in the attributes
that I want

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,800
at the bench other stuff that I don't
that I don't need

161
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,269
if you have a lot of data that you can
switch to reading and writing line by

162
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,880
line by keeping kinda dictionaries one
line at a time

163
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,190
and I've done this with the whole
OpenStreetMap planet before

164
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,910
several gigs is probably not a good idea
but it worked

165
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,100
it's great and because it's just a
dictionary it's really easy to create

166
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,610
test for the data

167
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,890
you can check for required he is cell

168
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,450
say an your database that's gonna keep
the steering use it for something is

169
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,899
expecting certain keys to be their knees
had the boundary type string that

170
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,779
represents the datasource

171
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,950
you can check each key is and

172
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,880
value is what you expected to be you can
check against the listed known values so

173
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,300
say they're only a certain number of
trusted sources

174
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,570
or your filters are expecting certain
values you can check and make sure

175
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,940
that's also had a time

176
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,130
you can check the structure you know how
deep did the dictionaries go

177
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,640
and check to make sure the geometry is
allied so you don't end up with no

178
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,110
island

179
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,440
so this is a really important if your
system is expecting a very very

180
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,370
particular format will your data comes
from a Grady of sources so

181
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,350
at UA we get data from all over the
place we get map on exterior week at

182
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,070
OpenStreetMap data

183
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,459
we get a bunch a random stuff the
customers give us

184
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:19,550
and it all needs to be in exactly the
right format every single feature

185
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,519
or production incident and after I did
that once I was never again

186
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,170
no more protection incidents vacated the
said over and said it s really easily

187
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:35,290
and just by going to the dictionaries
and checking for the things that matter

188
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,779
also on you can you speak shapely for
spatial analysis India manipulation

189
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,910
cheaply as a super powerful

190
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:47,220
would but a library and there are tons
examples in the manual I made this wall

191
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,750
tax just a que native

192
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,079
show you how many things it can do you
how powerful it is I N

193
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,690
you can construct geometry is simple
fire create buffer areas

194
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,630
murders Union check distances between
paying this

195
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,950
gets a magical dear friend see if one
object contains the other object on and

196
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,930
on and on and on

197
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,220
it even works with 3d data and numb hi

198
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,089
all kindsa stuff that you can do with it

199
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,430
so remember the GPX tracks that we put
together earlier well someone then it

200
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,260
turns out

201
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,870
I didn't show them but I have a bunch in
California I don't deal with a man on a

202
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,040
deal with my flight to California either
I want just the ones that are in

203
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,860
Portland

204
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,589
and I wanna go through them one by one
by hand

205
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:37,639
so what i did. first time you just get
your city as Judy Sun

206
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,019
and an I read Portland on an

207
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,480
and put it in a shapely shape object

208
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,230
its geometry that is and the same thing
for each had the tracks and that

209
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,720
original file

210
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,779
I read them into shapely shape our jacks
and then I was able to do this really

211
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,450
easy

212
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,700
laying here check if their geometry on
that track

213
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,959
is within the context whole of Portland

214
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,500
yet we're gonna keep it I use the convex
hull because there's a little-known very

215
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,950
small city called Maywood park that was
formed when nobody wanted a freeway

216
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,690
built through it

217
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,010
and and my Ajax would have been excluded
that that passed through there

218
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,760
so I got the context Hall which is the
smallest polygon that would contain

219
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,940
everything within it

220
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,170
menu just to write it out

221
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,709
so it kept all the stuff in pink not be

222
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:35,000
plane tracks in the in beige their

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,279
that I didn't whites that's great

224
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,070
on another great option for
geoprocessing without GIS software

225
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,370
is posts s and that is an extension to
post guess

226
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,000
an as you many you probably know it
already well

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,139
I'm you can talk to a psycho pg2 it
works really well and you can run space

228
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,829
operations

229
00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:02,300
directly with that and it works
surprisingly well

230
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,779
I finally GIS software love despite

231
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,220
on our GIS on

232
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,290
Azria I think it's actually sponsor Pike
on has on early

233
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,529
cool papon community is set section set
up

234
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:20,940
and they really like using our Python
for scripting they set up their own

235
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,070
arc pay module on that does all the
tasks within

236
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:33,050
I our GIS that you can skip to end other
create tools in Athens with them

237
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,839
cue Jess is kinda the closest open
source alternative to RJs

238
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,649
and it has it similarly it has a Python
console

239
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,760
it also has a cute this module that you
can

240
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,740
import from outside Azlan

241
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,199
outside a few to sell you can have a
third party app

242
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:57,240
that brings in the huge issue i

243
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,060
or or geoprocessing tools come without
actually having a Yankee jisne at school

244
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,209
on and development to cue just is
written in C

245
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:13,199
and input on C can contribute to the
development of it directly

246
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,550
there are more than 250 plugins already

247
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,660
for teachers and there are written in
Python

248
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,779
you can do you all kinds really really
interesting stuff this one is a

249
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:30,209
3d export an helps you make a 3d map in
a web browser with but GL

250
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:34,949
actually I talked way too ass i think im
over i think im we enter my time

251
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:38,459
so i think im just gonna open up for
questions that this plane

252
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,180
pincus I'll there's a there's a
microphone over there

253
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:49,180
if you need and

254
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,820
hi thank you very much I'd like to

255
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,399
ask if you would mind bring your first
slide back on so many copy your website

256
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,690
yes

257
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,209
sorry say their ego

258
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:09,820
thanks again for the talk home I've used
to own

259
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,449
no GRN GDAL am not familiar with the
owner can you

260
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:17,620
talk a little about the differences and
yeah so OJ

261
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,160
on the on actually uses ging Tom

262
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,040
armored kill people say either way I am

263
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,470
it it's just a paper on it kinda
interface to them see do you still have

264
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,600
to install the man you are actually
using them

265
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:37,120
just in a panic way

266
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,350
night arm great talk thank you think

267
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,259
arm I'm working on a project that

268
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:49,050
home SOC in modeling so the results that
we get

269
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,389
arm Havlat long date in the move also
got currents and stuff

270
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:58,269
we want work a social scientist that use
GIS so we've got beer in net CDR files

271
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:02,699
ok I N they watch shapefiles okay do you
have any recommendations on

272
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,539
I'll do that so so Oger

273
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,439
I am what that the guy in front of you
brought up came to you

274
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,669
almost any translation if ya know

275
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:18,230
works with a lot earlier she earned arm

276
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,270
sorry now and the words escaping me a
lot about your drivers

277
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,110
an piano works with them but it doesn't
support all them

278
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,590
I i'm not super familiar with the format
the

279
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,350
let CD after yeah i i'd I have used it
before said well

280
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,419
I don't have a particular tips for that
but yea I think I go to you may go to

281
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:39,850
his own gr

282
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,169
I'm which the only uses I am but doesn't
always support all the drivers I love

283
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:47,120
and that's just really is a command-line

284
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,080
I mean not really easy the people that
are free to the command line is

285
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,780
definitely not easy but

286
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,549
months you can to practice with a I'll
trust that I'm usually does the right

287
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:56,250
thing

288
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,710
okay thanks I'm

289
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,900
hi a I'm not sure the address the
spectrum

290
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,160
i was just curious about the biking data
like what format was that in

291
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,090
and also what did you use to visualize
the

292
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,620
yeah yet totally I can talk about that I
skipped

293
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,940
past six hours like I'm not gonna have
enough time in the head at a time

294
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,549
I am so this is actually not by King
David this is all of my data from

295
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,470
walking all around and traveling around
portland is an app called moots

296
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,640
and it basically tracks me all the time
in this is like a few months is

297
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,740
have news data and

298
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,860
so moose likely has a pretty friendly
API to plugs into a lot of tools there

299
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,350
said

300
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,809
an at a tool called moves export to use
to download a weak data at a time

301
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,990
because they didn't want to deal with
having to download them all individually

302
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:54,620
so once they had every week on as GPX
data so they will the download them as

303
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,169
GPX data

304
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,419
I'm fianna

305
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,720
can read there are actually several
layers in GPX data

306
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,160
track sir just wanted them see actually
have to tell Theon okay beat the tracks

307
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,900
layer

308
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,669
don't read the waypoints and I think
there are a few others

309
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:15,150
I am but once you have bad

310
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,730
and it's all thrown together so this
isn't that what i'll know

311
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,280
which is a knee I don't it's not

312
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,330
I don't know if it's open source I think
it's open source adds put up a company

313
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,750
called map box

314
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,559
and it's on top of their tiles here and
you use act something that's actually

315
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,789
cop car tow CSS to style

316
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:36,070
up and you get some composite operation
cited a

317
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,940
like a multiplying composite operations
that would be darker the places that I

318
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,070
want more

319
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,280
if you want to know more about town I
can I think Kansas

320
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,640
Google pile now a Google Map box and
it's really easy to get started with

321
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,419
them I'm

322
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:55,419
big fan map packs K thank you in

323
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,530
ppl

324
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:06,270
thanks guys thanks for coming out to
talk way

325
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,520
ok
