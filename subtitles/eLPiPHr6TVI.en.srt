1
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,179
welcome everyone

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,190
to Python packaging simplified by sheesh
law Rep

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:21,190
hi everyone

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,420
wow hi everyone higher grade

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,830
so I'm here to talk about Python
packaging simplified

6
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,820
and as fifth title fight to death I'll
provide information useful to end-users

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,870
app developers overt or contributors

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,520
this talk is focused mostly on people
who aren't the one

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,840
packaging things out there will be no
talk after this

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,059
in more depth I can talk about that and
also are

11
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,739
there's not a couple of micro changes
the most they don't care about sometimes

12
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:51,160
in the

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,399
in the %ah in the description I promise
to tell you how to debug

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,399
complicated conflict between Debian
install packages

15
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,719
and pick installed packages if people
really want to know that you can ask me

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,430
the questions about in time defeated

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,080
to fit in and do it justice %ah for that
third

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,909
I will explain to you the tools the
stalk I want everyone to attend this

19
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,540
talk to be able to install python code

20
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,720
on their own system without needing to
use root privileges or admin privileges

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,640
or pseudo

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,150
I of you want to have a basic
understanding

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,400
how to distribute pot bunker DU Britain
and I also want you to know how to learn

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,540
more because there isn't

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,270
%ah time to do justice to everything in
part on packaging land

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,960
to tell Paul if you know the basics

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,450
and what %uh the right questions to ask
and then you can do the right research

28
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,640
to find out the answers

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,119
let's talk about installing Python code
if you have a Python interpreter

30
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,619
if I look something like this: and if
you're lucky your Python interpreter

31
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,119
come the batteries included

32
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,170
one of those models as the numbers model
and women here imported

33
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,270
the numbers model ever yeah I just found
in a minute

34
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,280
in the pilots at a library article so
%ah

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,500
when you import anyway it give you think
you can print

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,200
and if you put the numbers module like
any module corporate the path

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,230
but it came from this is what are the
most important thing to know

38
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,280
about type of packaging that the model
object we'll tell you where it came from

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,030
if you let it tell u this can be super
useful in debugging

40
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,950
and it's driven by allister directories

41
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,220
that are searched when you import and
that left is an assist module fist up at

42
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,150
I it to lift it looks something like
this: the kinda long

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,400
the numbers model definitely came from
one of these entries

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,069
and the purpose again to stop at if so
that you can

45
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,510
if the Python interpreter will certainly
to these places

46
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,150
for a model or Sunday chemport untold
satisfies your request

47
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,400
fall highlight second one here

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,660
this path usually Python 2.7

49
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,129
is in fact where the numbers model came
from for that great

50
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,720
if you want to use papon Cerda comes in
a standard library you might want to

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,550
install things

52
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,769
artist and a library for example if it
around the time hurricane sandy

53
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,180
and you've been reading this website the
Greddy you might know

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,480
that these cookies are hurricane sandy
special

55
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,510
the you might wanna buy the handmade
available for you

56
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,650
on a tee and so if you're lucky you can
important at the module

57
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,870
by doing something like this the photo
here is a

58
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,500
snapshot from the cheese shop sketch
because that is where you can find

59
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,110
Python code to install the website name
is cheese shop

60
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,090
although its two main dispelled PyPI dot
type on that already

61
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,780
I think there's some history about it
being used to be called the cheese shop

62
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,159
and an outdoor called the cheese shop
but nobody thought that except in

63
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,760
record atop the icon but if you search
their

64
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,220
as you search on the cheese shop for at
the rapper

65
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,810
you want to find something in Iraq the
at the API then

66
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,900
%ah you put in that search to find a web
page that looks like this this is an

67
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,080
index packages mattina trapper

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,629
all zoom in just about where the mouse
pointer is on this first hit

69
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:08,629
I thought that at the so great they're
fun code on the cheese shop

70
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:12,500
the let you communicate with the at the
API this week but

71
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,659
itself pipe on that at the is the name
of the package

72
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,880
some love you might have already noticed
that if you try to import something

73
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,209
called I contacted at:

74
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,350
you get a syntax error this doesn't make
sense how conducting the call pipe on

75
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,600
dash at the

76
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,810
there's you can put a hyphen in a model
name so

77
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,590
the neighbor thing on the cheese shop is
not the model you're installing

78
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,009
if the so-called distribution happens
again tamper module

79
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:40,009
and who knows what model to contain
likely this would explain

80
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:43,330
on a cheese shop entry which you can see
here this is just

81
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,400
pat on the head the page on pikey I dot
tight on the target

82
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,290
and if that great it'll make it easy
interact with the at the API

83
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,350
that information on how to install it
and in the initialization section down

84
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,340
below

85
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,949
it tell you that it'll make a model
called at the the great

86
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,919
if you have this you can import at: for
review astute readers

87
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,860
might have noticed that the installation
instructions safe you know people still

88
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,970
at the anymore stood will noticed

89
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,880
itself sub P

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,389
if install at the so this the photo

91
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,330
other guy named thank you you know is
part of a band called world world order

92
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,949
they make fantastic robot ask
choreographed dance moves and the music

93
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,380
to back it up I recommend finding some
other videos the point is this what you

94
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,270
should be taking over me think it's you
know

95
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,910
you cannot be thinking setup install
because seato is extremely powerful way

96
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,130
to run any command

97
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,419
the result a bit are short on
recoverable fear system something you're

98
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:45,860
on a Mac or Linux system with Tito

99
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,120
can totally replace your operating
system

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,780
and if you're on Windows it'll give you
command not found

101
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,870
so this is sub-optimal also I wanna take
a brief digression to say hi first

102
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,620
got really involved in programming in
Python in 2001

103
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,860
I A wanted to write some code to convert
the high school newspapers

104
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,289
PageMaker 6.5 multi-page printed but the
newspaper

105
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:14,520
and generate a national website to the
web can be the future

106
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,539
and I newt a pipe bomb the great
languish right programs then

107
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,979
I've been learning to pop art in high
school but the

108
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:25,400
computer in the traffic light of it that
with the high school newspaper

109
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,300
I didn't have admin privileges on
privileges on it locally at the Teenage

110
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,750
Dream Katy the spot in a big deal

111
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,660
I downloaded a local privilege
escalation vulnerability so that I kid

112
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,500
get a cmd prompt running at the quality
admin username system

113
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,690
so that I can install python two-point
to

114
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,860
or something are people don't always
helps you don't take it home a run to

115
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,970
know

116
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,039
and they can't can that

117
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,460
likely there is a way to install python
package let me text you know and

118
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,810
I'll bring you back to the stop at in
particular want the entries in 5th up at

119
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,819
is inside your home directory or users
directory on Mac OS

120
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,870
or a Users folder or

121
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,030
documents and settings depending on the
version of Windows Iran

122
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,490
there's a place the pipe on have it will
look if you insulting

123
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,099
in the right way and there is a right
way and that way is this

124
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,880
if install double hoping user papon Nash
at the and I'll take this

125
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,020
type on that at the thing look it up on
poppy i

126
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,220
it'll download the source distribution
from party I

127
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,599
it'll succeed and a clean up her white
print cleaning up I get to remove the

128
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,069
temporary directories

129
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:34,520
art so after you do this you'll be able
to import at the

130
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,180
and when you do that that the model tell
you they came from inside your home

131
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,819
directory

132
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,789
so things look great I wanna pause for a
moment to reflect

133
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:47,340
we've seen module like at the model

134
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,250
we've seen distributions which what you
get from piper guy

135
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,919
I'm eating tools with Justin 12 or pic
install double happened user

136
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,090
we haven't talked about any useful
reason you through know yet

137
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,699
we haven't talked about virtual and get
and thats fine for now

138
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:04,849
so I'll pick

139
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,030
and pie PI are tall %ah

140
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,720
don't always work the way you want a
time you talk about a few the failure

141
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,389
mode

142
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,990
there is by the way a brand of ice cream
in India called quality felt this way

143
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,270
actually they stop being allowed to be
called ice cream because they

144
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,210
fatten the milk without vegetable fat
for the Al quality frozen desserts but

145
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,930
anyway

146
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,419
if you pip install double having user at
see

147
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,520
where the different distribution the
Python dash at the

148
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,839
to the totally different thing made by
some totally unrelated people

149
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,300
it happens also create a model called at
the eff you install it people give you

150
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,260
this helpful error message

151
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,250
and the reason to give you the specific
help where message is that the author

152
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,890
up this distribution uses read me file
would have a square bracket

153
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,269
inopportune place and the square bracket

154
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:58,050
means that pip not knowing what to do

155
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,769
like a little look through the read me
for length hoping they can find

156
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,860
a place to download the source code from
and of all I wanted the link

157
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,160
and a half square bracket to the other
definitely not be version 6 URL

158
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,470
and that is not numbers and fix our
Olympic exit

159
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,339
%ah so one problem by PI for some time
download URL

160
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,160
wrong or the army thing and in fact
there's no automated checking that when

161
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,720
you try to people stole something

162
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,950
from high PI that'll actually install

163
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,060
likely the first have these is fixed
with Pip 1.5 pip 1.5

164
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,959
and going forward will only install if
you pick in solving

165
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,390
along a little look for the distribution
only look for tar tar GZ or zip files

166
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,860
hosted on the Python package intact on
the cheese shop

167
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,860
so that text nothing does checked though

168
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,120
that things will actually install
adjustable only look on the cheese shop

169
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,600
another situation you might find a stop
running into is the bit obscure

170
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,580
%ah is if look for your installing them
by Concord

171
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,760
anything compatible with your printer
pipe on Python 3.2

172
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,850
and injured two don't get along 3.3 plus
great 2.7 great

173
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,910
not 3.2 but you might try to install it
not knowing any better and Pip

174
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,100
not knowing any better will try to
install it people run into this

175
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,190
contactor that doesn't work for
diversion a pipe bomb and of a great

176
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,700
I've successfully installed into two I
put in the right place I removed all the

177
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,930
temporary file

178
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,930
you like came life of some stuff school
by 15 imported

179
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,190
in a pot entrepreneur be like what are
you talking about

180
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,740
can run so at this point it might be
worth thinking about

181
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,820
on installation so

182
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,170
if you want to uninstall something but
the you install this module

183
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,029
called at the and you try to uninstall
it it might tell you

184
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:48,320
there's no requirement called at the
that because pip called

185
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,120
distributions requirement as a
distribution stalled called at the

186
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,010
at the at the module came in from the
pipe on dash at the distribution

187
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,880
okay began on a stopping for uninstall
and this by the way the huge improvement

188
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,010
for the past

189
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,410
there %ah used to not be any uninstall

190
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,769
from stuff from my PI for this actually
pretty good and

191
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:13,140
the uninstall process is driven through
this thing in pipe on on it eg

192
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,279
so there's %ah data directory that
contains information about the package

193
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,800
then rushed to distribution up in a min
the distribution

194
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,070
possum stop dot eg info and a thought
the file package data

195
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,720
is information about this particular
distribution

196
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,070
actually the getting renamed can be
called it in turn on again for but it's

197
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,010
not that important

198
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,440
if I the file is information from high
PI

199
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,510
I actually not I P R combat second I
information about the distribution

200
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,269
anyway

201
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:48,310
and when it gets filled in this
directory I should say also contains

202
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,490
information about what files were added

203
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,540
for that way pick and use that to drive
on installation process

204
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,959
and as nervous index so if you install
the module

205
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,430
pic doesn't really know where it came
from it hack

206
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,870
it but it can go from the name
distribution to the list if I'll

207
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,329
niggardly ball anyway at this directory
gets generated

208
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:12,389
because pip runs their head up high
command hang out and fight are not easy

209
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:13,700
to get downloaded

210
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,810
with this argument against info and that
generate all their

211
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,000
metadata I mean it run supped up I

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,360
this important point that up I isn't a
configuration file

213
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,079
the Python program happened to contain
configuration about how pipe on

214
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,290
distribution are should be installed

215
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,820
and through a common feeling about
people have they wanna

216
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,750
not repeat himself for the fair I missed
or the version number this

217
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,709
code inside the code and then in the
setup I

218
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:46,500
the import the project but this means
anyone elf

219
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,190
when they run the setup the pie because
they don't have the thing imported yet

220
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,079
a break in half the lovely is that for a
pipe programs can trip you up

221
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,170
%ah keep in mind actually programs
furthest up so far

222
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,050
the stock so far works great so long as
you have PEP but if you don't tip

223
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,930
well we've talked about how to get it so
if this is like

224
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,620
your life because you just installed
Ubuntu machine or something

225
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,120
then you'll need download it somehow
according to the pic website

226
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,310
the best way to do that is to download
the file get picked up I

227
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,670
and run that program on me knowing what
I said before

228
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,040
you should probably add data user to
that and if you do that

229
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,630
then great people get installed and you
won't be able to fight it in your shop

230
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,950
bad that okay because you can

231
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,190
at your shop at and how to do this
varies between shell

232
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,029
buried between when it distribution the
Mac OS and Windows

233
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:44,060
but you need to add something like this
this directory is the analog up that

234
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,970
directory your home folder this is where
scripts or programs are part-time

235
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,399
programs will be installed

236
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,839
so once you've added that yourself
search path

237
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,620
you get great so

238
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,630
let's talk about how distributed code

239
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,880
and I wanna take a bit of an example to
talk about at the Republic shopping

240
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,250
after Hurricane sandy

241
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,920
%ah I have the sweatshirt here like a
few kinda falling apart

242
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,100
it does have that cool octopus on it
though withholding the boats

243
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,360
I want another wannabes so I'm gonna
write a program maybe by wannabe

244
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,160
every year funded automate the thought
never forget and

245
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,560
will call it get occupy the name the
project but

246
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,240
because we're allowed to inconsistency
will make Python program called occupy

247
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,389
getter

248
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:32,660
rather how to model the Connacht I gotta
and I'm packing and unpacking

249
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,170
and it goes great from time passes I
read somewhere

250
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,420
but I need to start up I and a license
in order to make this

251
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,100
real open source product 5 at those an
hour's time

252
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,079
to register but the Python package index
other people other

253
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:50,980
octopus legend fiftieth can find a on
the Python package index

254
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,980
to do that you run the register command
which like print some stuff

255
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,089
and exceeds a great and then I if you
need a couple discovered

256
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:02,820
to the bottom package intact you have to
run these to command

257
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,110
at once it won't work to run them
separately

258
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,829
but if you do then it'll create a source
distribution

259
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:14,110
which'll be named after directory actual
will be named after suffering a startup

260
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,180
I'll come to that second

261
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,930
are and then a lot about the pikey I so
it all do something

262
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,000
little print from paying and will
succeed

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,630
for great %ah that works a long as you
know what to put in your set-up ifile

264
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,709
here is the simplest one that'll work
for the product I've described

265
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:35,589
the product is called get occupy so
it'll be available on

266
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:39,380
the cheese shop under the name can
occupy version 10

267
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,709
one up and had the one package occupy
getter

268
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,240
but actually above you may know there's
a difference

269
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,649
in core pipe on land between modules and
packages

270
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,370
and the little one file Python module
you have to spell it this way

271
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,089
high modulus I don't know why it'll
probably be

272
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:01,449
maybe that'll change Sunday we should
talk about that mean we can pick those

273
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:02,209
prints

274
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:06,709
%ah also this is the Python programs
that kind of weird that

275
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:09,800
if he does run this thing %ah

276
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,230
it'll print some stuff out normally with
Python program the way that people

277
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,149
structure them

278
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:17,350
if they had a little our protection for
that

279
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,769
it only runs I intentionally run it
papon's beat the program name

280
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,970
if you try to import set up we had
before

281
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,290
it would execute the setup I call which
is weird

282
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,839
I think most at a posh files written
this way

283
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,940
the people just don't do that they just
leave out the if name

284
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,199
main thing for great motors write them
the standard way

285
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,709
also by the way artist you till dark or

286
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:46,690
comes from around papon 1.5 and even in
the modern documentation you can t

287
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,910
remarks about how

288
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,490
did you tilt is great and in Python 1.6

289
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,980
things will be told the better and if
you tell and you can see that in the

290
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,660
carter Ham the pipe on three
documentation

291
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,060
not just the two thousand tho anyway I
may wish Elijah Smith after that so

292
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,169
I think I'm funny myself up some work at
Sprint so

293
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:10,549
you can add more information to this I
can talk about myself

294
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:13,319
more importantly I should write a
summary and description up this

295
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,100
particular

296
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,970
distribution I'm applauding the pie PI
I'll tell you how to find information

297
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,160
about that later

298
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,079
long story short you handle that stopped
you the fed up to par call

299
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,039
you think your argument for this is
great

300
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,340
I now have I thing on pipe yeah I called
occupy

301
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,450
have a model call up together don't
think it doesn't have

302
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,679
the program actually get flattered and

303
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:41,669
eventually I might write that I might
call main here's what it might look like

304
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:45,090
but what I would really want is way to
run that for the command line

305
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,220
little bit odd his python is really
about important things bring them inside

306
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,130
pipe on

307
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,190
likely there is a way to make people
command line script using them up the

308
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,240
pipe I'll

309
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,270
and it is using the every points keyword
argument

310
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,549
to the setup function this is

311
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:05,610
I a really interestingly complex line

312
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:10,380
is the key on the outside the key inside
consul script

313
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,610
and then there's a key/value pair stored
inside a string

314
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,030
but that's just how it is for that just
how you have to do it

315
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,870
the once you've done that %ah you can
run didn't stall

316
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,740
double hyphen user dot which means
whatever direct ramen

317
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,410
by the fed up the pie file their and
executed

318
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,820
and that will put the get now

319
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,919
program in here back so

320
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,539
you might run it this way and others
showing up here for good measure

321
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:43,090
so if you did run this inner shell after
running dip install

322
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,789
to live in user dot probably want to get
a command not found the key to pick your

323
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:48,250
path once you pick your path

324
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,760
you try again you'll get get now

325
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,470
I like naughty maybe it'll search for
the kind of things wanna buy

326
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,220
if you configured properly it will buy
them and tell you how much is spent

327
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,460
perfect and on the Internet can now
automate

328
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,070
their acquisition process so you upload
just by PI

329
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,630
again and somebody else read about that
but they're likely to see

330
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,539
when they run it is an error message so
we should probably talk about

331
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,510
dependencies

332
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,549
on your system you have an atty module
because you installed it

333
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:23,470
you think installed a wife and user
fight on their shitty on their system

334
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,450
they don't so we'll go back to the fed
up I file

335
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,500
going from there add one more

336
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
keyword argument install requires and
this year's the name

337
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,580
are the distribution that your
distribution depend on

338
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,250
so there are other ways to specify
dependent the panel does mention the

339
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,429
very briefly

340
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,179
there's a well-known one named the C dot
build-out there's another well-known one

341
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,600
name requirement that act

342
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,130
this lot built up is really good for
setting up

343
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,710
not just not just dating how to install
this particular part on distribution

344
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,710
buffer describing the state an
application including

345
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,460
rank-and-file down off the internet and
put in need to put into the right place

346
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,400
and so on requirements not taxed is a
good way to left

347
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,580
the specific distribution you have
installed

348
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,960
and at any given moment that you really
think your application works with

349
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,780
and you can pass that to PEP in a way
that I can talk about later

350
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,870
for this is all good we can now upload
think spy PI

351
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,900
we can distribute them in a way other
people

352
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,110
know about and can install based on with
the dependencies that directly

353
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,580
let's talk a bit about this development
workflow so we have mentioned it

354
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,450
you run this command ap you make it and
it's just up the pie about to start that

355
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,010
copy it all occurred

356
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,070
into your local five packages directory

357
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,240
which means that if you make a
modification and find the directory n

358
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,450
you have to go run pip install the hype
in user dart

359
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,080
again for them to show up but a bit
annoying sofa instead

360
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,240
and the double hyphen edible flag it
install

361
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,470
then it'll actually use the module from
right here

362
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,710
rather than copying them into your site
pat is rectory and link them

363
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,100
for this issue for useful by the way
that have an old name which is set up I

364
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,850
develop

365
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,090
I having tried both the can now say

366
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,340
defense all to live in user alive and
editable is told the better

367
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,270
but as always is that don't use that up
I develop if you mention other people in

368
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,789
your

369
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:21,460
development by ministrations you set up
the pie develop go fix that

370
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,590
so you might have also seen as a few
different places the provider setup

371
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,840
function we talk about the futile stock
or

372
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,260
but there's a thing called up tools
there's a thing called distribute

373
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,350
what are the which one to two years so
distribute is an old for conceptual

374
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,510
that is now merge back in few setup
tools

375
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,059
for don't use that and in that case your
these two choices

376
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,770
you can you use the wanna come for the
Python distribution digital stuck or

377
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,429
or you can use the one that sort it
seems cooler and have more features

378
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,230
called her up tools

379
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,110
doesn't really matter that much to me
just don't use distribute but also

380
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,049
I recommend using digital decor since
that way anyone who runs a pipe on

381
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:04,159
code in a startup I is guaranteed to
have

382
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,520
the requirements needed to execute that
set up I

383
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,130
file so

384
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,360
%ah if you're going along you might
discover the pipe on dash

385
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,490
at the version that you need the pipe on
a

386
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,650
at the module had a bug in version: 0.1
point zero

387
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,750
so you know that they operated at they
fixed the bug

388
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,880
you money to specify versions dependency
is like this

389
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,360
and if your code that relies on the spot
on the head to distribution the newer

390
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,630
version

391
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,100
conflict with him suck you already have
installed relies on the older version

392
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,130
you can have a bad time further is a
tool for separating these out

393
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,500
and it is called virtual and bushel and
for the way to separate out

394
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,140
Python packages are installed so that
you can get a fresh

395
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,289
empty Python for better or for worse
hopefully a better

396
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,020
that means that you have total control
over what's in there

397
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,159
and then once you've done this source
been activates tap

398
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,470
which will add these parental I

399
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,470
to your path to your cell

400
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,789
prompt rather the friend indicate what
the name and a special and is but it

401
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:15,669
sort of death is based on what directory
the vessel and then

402
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:19,240
%ah you can run usual to install
commands to you

403
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,179
make your code available in 5 a special
and there is by the way a shortcut for

404
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,820
defense all happened edible it is that
he

405
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,490
if you think this way they all drink
some water

406
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,950
if you think this way you're probably
gonna have a good life

407
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,539
fly you don't have to live in user to
pip install inside virtual and because

408
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,500
then I'll tell you that obscure error
message and

409
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,940
you just have to not have to live in
your inside virtual and okay

410
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,390
another doctor with virtual and it but
they are hiking along one terminally

411
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,020
over climate

412
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,539
activated so if you run python 5 death
terminal

413
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:00,000
and on the other stuff from you your
virtual and that if you open a new

414
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,890
terminal window

415
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,610
virtual on won't be activated and now
you have to reactivate it

416
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,960
or get totally confused

417
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,960
so I think that the active its grip is
kinda confusing

418
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,760
you can use virtual and that you can
activate script all by just calling the

419
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,679
particular copy a python that it put in
that directory

420
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,750
the virtual and tool will create a bin
directory inside that will be been five

421
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,510
papon

422
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,570
you can try been firefight on every time
and then you'll never have to

423
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,610
have confusion another problem I ran
into you

424
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,210
is if you need to install nada Georgia
Tonga the punker with some tea depending

425
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,830
how many people seen an aromatic

426
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,059
like this yeah now we're getting
somewhere so

427
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:46,039
%ah if you wanna see compiler nothing
tell you exactly need to do here

428
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:49,539
it's just like so what I would do

429
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:53,960
is I would involve out now module from
the oven to you or the debian package

430
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,169
because

431
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:58,390
those have been today many people are
gonna compiling stuff

432
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,100
I'm other get a composite Fatima Devin
developer but you might not be is going

433
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,210
to compile it up and I am

434
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,409
so in that case I

435
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:09,510
you might Afghan ball python it'll be
great you can import Alex Mel

436
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,669
will be right there and to try to pick
up all Alcatel it will actually

437
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:13,539
satisfactorily

438
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:16,720
day our channels already there I'm not
gonna try

439
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,020
as good doesn't try the data might fail

440
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,590
but if you do this in a virtual and you
won't have the system I like to now

441
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,669
available

442
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:28,100
will be like nope and if you really need
to you

443
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,570
compile virtual and compile look for now

444
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,529
or another python package that have few
dependencies

445
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:38,549
then you can use their

446
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:42,210
Debbie and functionality to get the
particular

447
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,450
bit the code on your system needed to
compile

448
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,890
the debian package call pipe on dash
Alexa now

449
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,929
the Khyber way to abuse the pipe thought
the Debian packaging system

450
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:56,049
of these four have been too because what
you're going to do is not

451
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:59,250
actually build the official debian
package you can use this to build a

452
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,070
different

453
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,070
version of the same I tonka

454
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,770
we'll have all the stuff you need in
order to do that so when faced with

455
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,940
these are two problems

456
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,760
a lot of people think I know are you
bigger and we'll talk about that

457
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,049
vagrant is I great virtualization system

458
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:19,679
it takes like half a gigabyte upstate
you need

459
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,140
have a great need to have powerful
machine tool like little bar

460
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,590
need to download from for have been to a
Debian image and when you do that

461
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,490
on her to live by a day and a half ago
for me you know that you're in for an

462
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,490
hour and a half long wait

463
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,779
and then %ah if things go well you can
type this command

464
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:39,380
the competition vagrant will

465
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,179
then look for a file called even file
it'll look for all the steps

466
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:46,679
in there needed to turn this instruction
set into

467
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,000
working virtual machine image that
running on your computer

468
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,110
because as far as I can tell Mac OS
people find it hard to install software

469
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,210
we have to install folder to Linux
distribution in order to install

470
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,860
software

471
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,390
once you run this command then I

472
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,630
vagrant will run lever provisioning tool
you have configured insider bigger

473
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,760
file for that means waiting time for
puppet or staff rentable

474
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,919
or shell script or make files or who
knows what to build your VM and if that

475
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:12,799
worked out

476
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,919
it'll be great you took a long time ago
so

477
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,990
let's think about things were different
perspective if you're that guy and

478
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,659
you're staring out into the distance

479
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:23,710
knowing that things do not happen fast
enough

480
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,429
horrifying things will occur if you new
engineers your company you wanna give

481
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:30,230
them a good time when it first happened
on your code

482
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,409
or give new ovens or contributors your
open source project

483
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,470
or you just want to have a speed your
life

484
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,110
you might want to come out other way if
to handle these are two problems

485
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,360
so I'm gonna tell you about the way that
the open have product

486
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,120
which is an open source web app for
helping fittingly you contributors find

487
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,460
open source project to work on

488
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,820
an offer so we have a setup that allows
us to go from nothing

489
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,880
dust to pile entrepreneur on your
computer to a full running Django app in

490
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,620
five minutes

491
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,500
we do that number to land to do it up
install we do about it. compiler

492
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,929
we use the database for on with pipe
bomb too polite

493
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:09,179
and I get in Fayette but we don't use to
know either

494
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:12,700
unfortunately Django actually sorta
requires some

495
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,779
compiled code it requires the Python
imaging library modules

496
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:20,289
if you're going to use turn
functionality the you might think that

497
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:20,789
you can

498
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:24,630
import image but unfortunately images
not gonna love the Python interpreter

499
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,570
for that's fine you might out except to
the import

500
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,179
and what we do if we do this crazy hack
well we take

501
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,380
it only random unrelated model and we
stick it insist on module

502
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,659
for that way import image you will
totally get something what you're

503
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:40,120
getting at

504
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,760
outright lie

505
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,070
but this is important because the Django
image feel otherwise failed to

506
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,529
initialize urging a web app

507
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:52,490
we need to manage my run server it'll be
like know your models don't validate

508
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,679
and the new personal be like to dominate
the compiler

509
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:59,929
190 compiler to make a web app don't
understand

510
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:04,590
so we also have some tricks that has
weed I the filing showed you is a model

511
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,669
call based flash depends up I

512
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:09,700
for then we can check if they thought
the pen but images non

513
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,720
and if so do is get the stuff

514
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,730
I mention we do this all but %uh
personal and so what we do is we

515
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,700
just argues Pepe to install are
dependent these into a directory called

516
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,409
bender

517
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:24,529
and then we modifies the star power

518
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:28,450
which is that directory of places Python
will go search for

519
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,110
things to include all subdirectories
we've had in fact the vendor directory

520
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,299
and if you wanna learn more about this
we're using a trick created by them as a

521
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:36,529
look at the project

522
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:40,010
for you know what an idea you can search
for that here

523
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,510
finally in terms are the jagger settings
to make sure that the

524
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,830
databases don't require complex up we
use

525
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,580
seek a light as the default database we
do have on environment variable the you

526
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,190
can't that

527
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,899
so that if you want to use the database
for use in production but in our case is

528
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:55,610
my tickle

529
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,390
we keep that information in a different
dictionary in the settings file

530
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,260
and then we dispatch based on the value
this environment variable

531
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,820
for forgetting Terry we won another
really worked in practice

532
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,730
and snow that we have an automated bot
check are stolen truck and every day

533
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:14,460
and this is that but talking and I see
telling of to over the

534
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,909
that things will work if you contribute
a shows up and also to take about two

535
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:19,549
minutes 51 seconds

536
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:23,200
so if you're human you type slower than
a bot I think it's fair to say that

537
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,799
it'll take

538
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,850
about five minutes for the kid that's
how we

539
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,700
make new contributors on a process for
one drink a bit about

540
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,799
really easy you can apply from similar
tactics to your app's

541
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,860
one other thing of a that this pop
helped us know that all the dependencies

542
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,970
actually work against the version of the
website the bundle

543
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,279
a tried we want people to use so a
common problem as I mentioned before is

544
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,000
people

545
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,159
require one person or something I in the
dependencies files

546
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,659
but then happen to have something else
installed in their own machines

547
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:00,570
so they don't find out that it would
fail for you contribute and I think day

548
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,450
I mean we we failed when you consider
this way if I wanna not build any more

549
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,890
the robot check it for these you don't
have to

550
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:12,070
there's one other before the topic I
wonder stuff

551
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,320
so some Python modules are pretty
Florence all twisted has won the pic but

552
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,690
41 seconds on my laptop a few days ago
that party to the compiled a bunch of

553
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,320
stuff

554
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,370
when would be great if the second time
you installed it

555
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,549
pic just knew oh yeah how to download
that I already

556
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:31,880
compile the seeker I'm just gonna story
on copy and place

557
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,960
and it can do that now thanks to the
school thing called we'll

558
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,789
which our way to take the result the sup
I build process

559
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:43,130
snapshot it and then whenever you redo
the install process just

560
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:47,200
unpack that we'll into place a required
thing is complicated environment

561
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,789
variable

562
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:50,850
there is a right way to fight them and I
can tell you that here

563
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:55,429
but I am going to tell you instead is to
go to cliff left how its website

564
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:59,600
Feb 2014 a comedy set up about a day ago
which contained a shell script

565
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,710
and a Mac App you can use to you

566
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,720
that these things up for you correctly
it's really awesome

567
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,289
I recommend reading a shock at the
plantation it

568
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:13,679
I complicated and get the and kisses
right back from your testing he did with

569
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,279
me

570
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:17,850
and some other people so you can go
there if we could be beatified

571
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,980
also along the problem the talked about
therefore

572
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,820
come from compiled code against combined
with Python code

573
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,750
so-called Python extension and we over
one way to solve that

574
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,039
another common when the pot they're fine
to the community is a different package

575
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:34,730
manager

576
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,210
other than Pepe called Honda but I don't
wanna mention to make sure people know

577
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,279
dick death

578
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,940
it has a really active user base in the
scientific world so consider using it

579
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,240
there's another way that you can use all
these tools

580
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,590
pipe yard dash install the program kinda
like pet

581
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,460
that in federal going into letting
things from Pepe running setup I

582
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,470
and putting them in tears I packages
directly it'll do something very much

583
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,419
like that

584
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:02,799
little first make it up that file which
if you're running Ubuntu or Debian might

585
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,380
be awesome

586
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,149
for me it's totally awesome I can use my
package manager to find out

587
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:11,950
which distributions from pie P II
responsible for which by the models have

588
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,620
installed

589
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,350
but he's in my package manager search
tools our Quick Shop and how many people

590
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,510
here run Debian and Ubuntu other main

591
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,789
workstation our Wow okay more than I
thought

592
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:25,840
many have have still if you like it I P
I dash install a few that now

593
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,929
because Paul tightly Monte sitting in
the front row here

594
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:32,899
fixed it earlier today is broken you to
change in the

595
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:37,399
back on the right website which has been
fixed in does offer to let us talk about

596
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:38,890
the conference in a different fashion

597
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:43,100
called %eh petrol and it'll take a
requirement that text file

598
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,149
to the long list specific versions to
install and make a virtual and

599
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:51,450
you can then install with about that
file

600
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,779
so but actually a half million have to
take some questions of summer I've

601
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:59,260
now I hope you've seen the you can
install software from the Python package

602
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,120
intact

603
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,500
the cheese shop I hope you've seen how
to distribute it at least

604
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,919
in the broad strokes and you know how to
find out more

605
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,599
the best place to find out more is
packing up I pondered Oregon

606
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,320
unless you just what happens work at a
bar I mean packing the pot under a good

607
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,720
grade

608
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,639
it tell u how things work Feb 2014 dot
com

609
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,070
will help you in Seoul pip and from
shell configuration

610
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,730
or Mac App if you use Mac that will set
it up for you

611
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,149
double having user by default my raps
type that again

612
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:34,070
out a box on no account with after death
is giving a much more detailed look

613
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,770
how pat on packing is going to be even
better in the coming years

614
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:44,770
thanks and apology sleeping tenors I've
attended

615
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,730
please join me in thanking issues do we
have any

616
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,470
people that when asked questions I'm not
a question for small great talk thank

617
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,320
you very much

618
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,680
on another I was afraid it is something
else I I've now now I

619
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,970
just one thing that I find use for on
that you left out was om

620
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,700
pip dashed ass system site packages

621
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,380
virtual and yeah I'm sorry yes right so

622
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,360
that allows you to create a virtual am
that uses some good stuff that's

623
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,530
%uh apt-get install or whatever your
package manager happens to be

624
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,120
and then you can add stuff from the
cheese shop into virtual

625
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,180
yeah yeah thank you for theft and it's a
totally useful thing I

626
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,000
maybe added to defied for that people
after it can see that

627
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,150
petrol and have an option where

628
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,650
it will let you use code: installed
system while

629
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:47,570
left okay go ahead that that's the
thanks I get for setting up a website

630
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:52,030
week look thank you so much also click
bought pic dot works but unfortunately

631
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,060
is not ready yet will be available soon
as I understand

632
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,430
but work to the pound it up a little
demand now yeah I'm

633
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,110
Irish that but there's an SSL
certificate and everything you can

634
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:02,760
actually download

635
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,740
happen this from me on one thing I want
action point out another

636
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,710
suggestions helpful since so many people
unpacking here

637
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,030
of outreach and education this is a
fantastic talk

638
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,170
Charles classes internal the workings

639
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,510
happens tools this Charles all those
things and it's great and all that stuff

640
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,660
on many have you might

641
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,020
be tempted your introducing you people
the Python

642
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,470
to explain all of this intricate
interesting detail I

643
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:37,800
having been present many workshops help

644
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,840
on I'm just caution not

645
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,050
hurts anything about any of this up

646
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,300
truck reason like I'd brought the shell
script eventually

647
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,990
domain was that it's hard not to learn
to program

648
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,460
and if you give people instructions
station work

649
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,280
and that shouldn't have to know why
especially cuz all it's actually

650
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,730
happening

651
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,680
type South tools all these things is its
dollars in

652
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,640
computers use it and the so they can
uses all

653
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,910
locations distributions taxes so use
this knowledge

654
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:15,120
good and don't pass it on to people's
the first

655
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,250
about variant so hofer that's useful

656
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:23,610
yeah it's a beautiful this domain as
great I tattooed on my debut

657
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,880
machine other people tested it on Mac OS
just to add to that

658
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,620
according to echo what cliff said that
if you're running

659
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,520
introductory workshops that you can skip
talking about this

660
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,040
so the you talk about things you have to
want to talk about %ah

661
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,530
I received some method by

662
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,000
on a website recently that if you want
to give advice to people

663
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,430
you probably want to find out for that
this further this talk

664
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,150
explain why you have to do things the
way

665
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,810
that the shell script recommend that I
recommend here but I

666
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,960
explaining why isn't always the most
useful thing so

667
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,130
thinking about moving back to somebody
new means you just didn't explain that

668
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,430
go ahead yeah I a

669
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:10,080
I've I'm a question like a I maintain
some Python packages and I've

670
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,380
some trouble getting set up to pee like
work everywhere in a

671
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,410
work work right for example I don't want
to include a long description so I just

672
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:21,160
with Read Me file but of course that
breaks for some older version setup

673
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,600
tools or something so

674
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,270
are there is there some were definitive
to me

675
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,760
the definitive guide right to PP license
bulletproof

676
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,760
thank you so I don't know either

677
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,820
died for how to write have the highest
bulletproof but I'm

678
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,220
I author is one now okay %ah but

679
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,290
I will give you a few quick tips one is

680
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,610
never run set up top high directly

681
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:50,860
unless you have to you so if you tell
people to run pip install

682
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,320
whatever doc or your thing people run to
the pie for you

683
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,060
and picked up some crazy magic for that
unique you do from this year till dark

684
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,730
or

685
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:04,040
important up will be like haha nope I
put the setup tool set up there instead

686
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,520
and this means that people don't need
any particular britain effect on their

687
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,230
systems people for to make sure that
happens quickly

688
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,730
I think so actually

689
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:17,880
it will still if you have set up tools
and but it older version it will still

690
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,790
use that so it won't break so it might
remove some of the files from the

691
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,540
package but

692
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:28,540
that that's beyond beyond the scope
thank you very much okay I think the top

693
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,260
one more question

694
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,290
%ah this is probably also getting a
little bit

695
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:39,000
a beyond scope but on does open hatcher
have you had any experience using pi am

696
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,740
up which is sorta RBM pipe a python for
managing different versions of Python

697
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,910
things like that so a question about
different versions

698
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,410
papon thought your system perhaps
manager I and I don't have any

699
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,490
experience with that

700
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,670
I sorta win at the idea of order in the
pipe on the bottom on one machine

701
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,750
another other people for to the person
giving a talk right after mine

702
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,600
winter that the idea have not having of
over

703
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,640
the Python on one machine but I just in
too many users confused

704
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,130
by I open a new terminal and I couldn't
import this thing

705
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,510
and the answer turned out to be that the
bring a pipe on the running here

706
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:19,220
not a virgin running the height on the
running their and why do I need to

707
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,080
explain this

708
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,180
so where possible I try really hard
never have to explain that bind refusing

709
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,210
to install more than one Briton a python

710
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:34,080
minimize the use a virtual and and buy
back many papers although I can user

711
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,790
again a please join me in thanking and
she's for a great act
