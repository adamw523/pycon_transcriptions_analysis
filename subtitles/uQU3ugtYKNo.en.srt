1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,659
I'm yes so let's let's welcome
vandenberg

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:10,659
so one of the things that I can do

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,540
that is really really the best part

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,699
have I love descend this entire thing is
that I get to say thanks

5
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:24,230
so I'm gonna begin by actually taking a
survey about who's using few different P

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,269
features in Python if you wanna rip use
one of these features please raise your

7
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:28,830
hand

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,329
I bisect collections

9
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,710
de small punk tools

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,040
keep cue inter tools

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,210
Jas on math cue

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,890
random names to pull

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,500
enumerate sets

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,199
the new conditional expressions reverse
iteration

15
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,690
ordered X have a generator expressions

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,030
if you use any of these features

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:11,030
you need to think Raymond Hettinger

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,510
Raymond is the originator maintain our
pep author for each one of these

19
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,150
features

20
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,060
and he's done an amazing amount more
he's been around the pad thai community

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,730
for well over a decade

22
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,720
I believe about 12 years since his first
post on comp in Python

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,190
he has three thousand 812 commits to

24
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,590
the Python depository he has a 160

25
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,140
commits to the paper posit ori and 8,000

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,660
89,000 716 lines and Python repository
where either added or changed by him

27
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,560
he's also served as director the Python
Software Foundation

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,900
and been a mentor to many many people on
a meaningless

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,110
so I'm happy today

30
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:04,110
Raymond coming up here

31
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,900
and

32
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,540
the Distinguished Service Award is the
highest award given by the pipe and

33
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,670
stopper foundation

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,099
signifies essentially a life and work

35
00:02:55,099 --> 00:03:02,099
and sell thank you a min

36
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,489
I also get to highlight a couple other
people on

37
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:18,360
David are David Murray come up

38
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,480
young

39
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,840
dollar where the switch to unit code in
Python 3

40
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,170
well one of the places in which that
gets the most hairy

41
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,430
is in the email module and

42
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,680
david has spent the past several years
untangling that because

43
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,750
all up the email RC's were written
before you know code literally

44
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,120
and so it's a complete mess Masham
understanding

45
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,319
sometimes it stayed at sometimes had sex
in going back and forth

46
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,769
and he's also been a longtime mentor for
new contributors

47
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,160
he helped people in the car mentorship
main less some pipe and av

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,250
on the IRC channel he's a Google Summer
of Code mentor

49
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,330
been a big help on-boarding Google
Summer of Code and

50
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:07,430
and unknown ok and its his patience is
really unparalleled

51
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,709
and so I am happy to award the community
service work AR David Murray

52
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:18,709
the

53
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:27,509
I also wanted to recognize Benjamin
Pearson

54
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,639
%ah Benjamin is since so many different
places

55
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,639
in Benjamin are you here he's probably
fixing code

56
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,800
and I think I don't know if you noticed
that

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,350
Fernanda per said that he needed
something had I think was pat 465 maybe

58
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,240
3465 and Benjamin a couple hours later
he did it

59
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,020
and he the release manager for pat on 27

60
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,810
who works on the six compatibility
libraries pics many many bugs on the new

61
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,780
bike and our org

62
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,160
he artiste received eight community
service were in 2011 but we wanted to

63
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,340
give him a special recognition for all
the things he's done in it's actually

64
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,260
one more word

65
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,840
i've been searching about the code and
people who have affected

66
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,090
almost through the code but there's one
way the

67
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,200
other thing that all of us in this room
share and that is that we have been

68
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,040
touched in affected by this person

69
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,740
this is the largest gathering

70
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,530
I love Python programmers that will take
place in the world this year

71
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,000
and there are so many people to thank

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,530
I Matthew David Yanick Stewart

73
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,200
all the Montreal Python but there's one

74
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,200
yes

75
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,910
there are literally too many to name but
there's

76
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,120
one person who has put in literally the
many many hundreds about hours

77
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
to chair Pike on this year

78
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,240
and that's Diana Clark

79
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,860
in own

80
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,750
it's amazing to have so many people who
are willing to share in contribute

81
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,130
in our community in a community that's a
really important word for us

82
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,360
three years ago

83
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,750
a couple professors actually I

84
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,030
war decided study code diversity

85
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,440
instead the study community actually the
the growth and development various

86
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,050
communities

87
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,860
and the fountain indicators and growth
and development and well-being and

88
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,610
happiness

89
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,860
and they found various communities that
had had

90
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,300
historic record a history going back
thousands have years and some that had

91
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,780
been

92
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,550
isolated until relatively recently and
they studied these

93
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,620
and they've decided to stand see what
made these communities successful

94
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,170
don't wanna share three things from
their study

95
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,640
the key question their research was

96
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,680
is it better to be more similar

97
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,760
or more different and they look at a lot
of different

98
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,380
end indications I'd I'm entered a look
at economic growth they look dead

99
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,220
well-being they look it migration
patterns they look at the ability

100
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,320
have other people to get there they look
at records from other people visiting

101
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,740
and look at all these things and they
tried to figure out

102
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,550
it having more and different people a
benefit

103
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,040
or is it something that that it really
hold you back

104
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,220
and what they found was really really
interesting

105
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,060
they found that when a community with
very new

106
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,050
it was being having people be very
similar be very homogeneous

107
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,790
was a huge asset and the reason why is
because

108
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,960
when you were new you didn't have to ask

109
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,480
what your neighbor would think about
something you just knew because you knew

110
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
how your neighbours think you know
they're

111
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,500
how they would react you

112
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,349
were able to be aligned because
everybody was unlike

113
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,160
now here's the surprising part debt as

114
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,980
society started to become more complex
through the Renaissance and especially

115
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,060
through the Industrial Revolution

116
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,580
devalue ugh similarity

117
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,150
plummeted and the value of being
different

118
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,110
skyrocketed it actually turned out

119
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,190
that these communities that had had a
little bit

120
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,900
%uh the head start earlier earlier in
basically agricultural times

121
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,230
started to stagnate and the ones that
had

122
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,020
these influences from all over had
different viewpoints different people

123
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,900
different values different points of
view day

124
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,030
started to really become successful a
model on many different direct

125
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,850
dimensions so

126
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,760
this is the first point diversity

127
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,100
is a necessary response a complexity
unless we are willing

128
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,290
to accept many people with many
different viewpoints into our community

129
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,380
we are going have been the different in

130
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,400
all the different inputs that we really
need to grow second

131
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,120
is that date at that look further into
the data they found that there was a

132
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,690
rich get richer affect

133
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,680
foreign many these communities some of
them

134
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,140
at society advances the communities that
are relatively more diverse

135
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,180
tend to attract more opportunities they
have more growth

136
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,470
and so that brings in new people and new
ideas and new viewpoints

137
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,610
which sets of a virtuous cycle but

138
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,110
it also they also found that the
communities that were relatively less

139
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,750
diverse

140
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,089
tended to have fewer people in few
opportunities

141
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,010
and two people left opportunities dried
up and they stagnated

142
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,400
this is the second point

143
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,410
is that diversity creates a virtuous
cycle

144
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,500
if we are willing to reach out

145
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,770
we can outgrow and out thinkin
out-compete

146
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,220
the people around us now this is true

147
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,270
in open source communities as well

148
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,930
particularly this is true in the Python
community

149
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,400
when first started out it's true we had
a as substantial

150
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,320
group people we were very similar who
had a couple people and I'd like to

151
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,850
especially I highlight people like lynn
route

152
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:07,850
and Jessica McKellar who've been

153
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,980
we had these people who are dedicated to
helping us reach out

154
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,490
and we've had about five years an effort
and since then we've been on the path

155
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,560
for greater growth in greater diversity

156
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,530
and you can see it in this hall
reflected at this conference we have

157
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,839
people from fifty did two different
nations across

158
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,700
all inhabit six continents mosey it even
more in gender diversity

159
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,070
we don't ask for gender on on our
registration form

160
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,820
but we can do a little bit love machine
learning on your names and we can look

161
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,360
at T-shirts

162
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,190
I we conditions Disick assist this is
statistical sampling

163
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,970
and sometimes I can say that weren't
sometimes I can't

164
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,160
and it will it appears to us from all
the data that we have

165
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,760
is not only do we have one-third women
speakers we have one third win in

166
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,760
attendees the

167
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,930
so I'm really excited about that number

168
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,240
because the most recent survey from the
computing research associations

169
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,000
I graduation numbers indicated that only
12 percent

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,480
computer science graduates in the in the
year 2011 to 2012

171
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,020
where women that means that we are
pulling more than our weight

172
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,260
amongst various communities we

173
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,370
and

174
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,020
we are winning we r on that virtuous
cycle and sell

175
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,070
when I look out across as through icy
community

176
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,850
that it better prepared to meet the
future and better prepare to win and

177
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,490
compete

178
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,580
than any other that brings me to the
fair point

179
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,870
and that is that diversity requires
individualization

180
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,580
diversity maybe 8 necessary response to
complexity

181
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,730
but diversity itself brings

182
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,850
with it its own complexity think back to
the professors in their study

183
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,260
when people are very similar it's really
easy for people communicate again

184
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,980
because they're

185
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,459
all like because there are they're all
lined because they're all like

186
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:25,740
but when society starts to become more
complex

187
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,120
the communities with greater diversity
are able to prosper because they include

188
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,930
people with different points of view

189
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,900
and who think and value different things
who have different use cases and want

190
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,100
and may at hugely different number

191
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,720
to go ahead choose a different number
directions you can't predict

192
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,420
what your neighbors going think anymore
though so you need to take more time to

193
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,089
communicate

194
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:54,240
in our own community we need to think
about this in terms

195
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,160
up acceptance an individualization
greater diversity means that we need to

196
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,450
work harder to understand those around
us

197
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,580
and to be empathetic to the very man the
various places that they're coming from

198
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,820
you know I was talking with a couple
attendees the other night

199
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,790
and one of them said and this is calling
it as close as I can

200
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,700
said I consider it much more important
that I was raised in New York

201
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,959
and had a liberal arts major before I
started code those things do much more

202
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,760
to define me and Who I am than the fact
that I'm a woman

203
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,810
it was well said I we can't be lazy

204
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,250
and treat people like their
one-dimensional on any line

205
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,690
be it race or gender or politics or
culture

206
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,360
or anything because the value comes in
understanding

207
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,560
that we have many different viewpoints
in are many different people

208
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,640
at this is were Frank and

209
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,100
this is were affected in the code of
conduct for MPS after I know we talked

210
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,880
about this

211
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,209
%uh the codes of conduct a little bit
Brett dead

212
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:02,100
on the first day so many are familiar
with his and a pipe on

213
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,329
and what how that has guided us in
actually

214
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:10,829
creating iconic code but there is really

215
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:15,040
a then have Python community and i think
that that was the one that was written

216
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,160
by Brian curtain

217
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,260
you know

218
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,450
you can see it

219
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,870
my favorite quote from this conference
so far came actually from Lawrence and

220
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,450
cut then

221
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,589
who said that just being at Pike and
make some more optimistic around the

222
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:32,020
world

223
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,589
so the colored contact this

224
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:41,300
den a python community is says and I'm
gonna read it to make sure I get it

225
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,630
right

226
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,420
the Python community is made up of
members from around the globe

227
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,940
with a diverse set of skills
personalities and experiences

228
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,870
is through these differences that our
community experiences great successes

229
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,209
and continued growth

230
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:57,470
when you're working with members to the
community we encourage you to follow

231
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,040
these guidelines: which help steer our
interactions

232
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,630
and strive to keep right on a positive
success on growing community

233
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,920
and member the Python community is open

234
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,750
we're open members of the community are
open collaboration with their time

235
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,250
perhaps

236
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,740
patches problems or otherwise were Sep
22 destructive common criticism

237
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,270
as experiences and skills that other
members contribute to the hole in our

238
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,170
efforts

239
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,339
work setting up all who wish to take
part in our activities

240
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,150
fostering an environment where anyone
can participate any everyone can make a

241
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,720
difference

242
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,579
considered members to the community
community are considered up their peers

243
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:39,220
other Python users working at toppling
addressing the efforts of others keeping

244
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,620
in mind that oftentimes the labor

245
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,699
was completed simply for the good of the
community

246
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,699
where attentive in our communications
whether in person or online

247
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:51,839
more tactful one approach approaching
different views

248
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,140
highly respectful members the community
are respectful

249
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,660
respectful of others depositions their
skills their commitment and their

250
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,790
efforts

251
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,640
we respect for the volunteer efforts
that permeate the pipe and community

252
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,829
we respect for the processes set forth
in our community

253
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:12,390
and we work within them when we disagree
we are courteous and raising our issues

254
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,370
overall we are good to each other we
contribute to this community not because

255
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,250
we have to

256
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,740
but because we want to if we remember
that these guidelines will come

257
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,120
naturally

258
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,020
you'll notice the Python code of conduct
and quote by the way

259
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,800
is about who we are and what we value
here in the Python community

260
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,620
we recognize that we are different
people with different experiences and we

261
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,770
explicitly value that

262
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:43,350
we reach out but where does that leave
the PSF

263
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:48,150
it's clear that as a community we have
turned toward the corner toward greater

264
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,870
growth and greater diversity

265
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,640
and we're starting to rate the the
benefits at that

266
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,700
but I have to say dad as

267
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,480
an organization PSF hasn't kept him
hasn't kept up

268
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,770
it's over the past year and a half their
Ben many discussions

269
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:11,780
and boats and a lot of work thinking
about what defines us as an organization

270
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,440
and how we can better reflect the
worldwide Python community

271
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,320
and so I'm happy today to announce the
combination up that effort

272
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,590
cell love those who are here now how
many are currently members at the PSF

273
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,770
be courageous and

274
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:35,770
gate now others who are here how many
members at the pad thai community

275
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,919
you see the difference that's completely
unacceptable

276
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,060
our communities become bigger and more
diverse

277
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,450
and stronger and we as an organization
were in keeping up

278
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,570
that is why as it today the PSF is
transitioning to an open membership

279
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,310
model

280
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,780
everybody who's in the Python community
is welcomed and encouraged

281
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,900
to become a member the PSF

282
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:10,900
the

283
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,280
in fact if you go to the new Python a
dork and you scroll down to the bottom

284
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,510
you'll see a button that says become a
member PSF

285
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,200
you fill out a form you agree to the
code of conduct

286
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,670
he say I am a part of this community and
I agreed to these values

287
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,910
I will be kind I will be respectful I
will be considerate

288
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,510
and you are a member the PSF we've also
said it

289
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,770
we've also created a new structure
called working group

290
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,860
where people can we can

291
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,810
bring up the things that they are doing
to help support

292
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,380
others in the community we don't have to
think about all these ideas are cells

293
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,770
and the PSF can in a structured way

294
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,650
help you and recognize you and those who
are working in dedicating

295
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:02,480
whether it be in organization whether it
be in cold weather been documentation or

296
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,180
Tess

297
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,200
or leadership or outreach we want to
support you

298
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,530
and those who are involved will have the
opportunity to be

299
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,890
do to actually be eligible to vote an
exercise

300
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,470
a role in guiding where r where the PSF
goes in the future

301
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,640
we've reworked are

302
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,130
the bylaws to be radically more
inclusive and representative

303
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:31,210
Python community as a whole and this is
one of the things that

304
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,400
where we're just starting on this is

305
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,610
a new direction that frankly no other
community that I'm aware of has gone in

306
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,980
especially with regard to creating

307
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,870
the way for us to elevate empower and
support

308
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,930
individual efforts from across the
Python community

309
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,910
so I ask you for your patience as we go
forward

310
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,870
because we're gonna have various places
where it's going

311
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,340
word gonna have glitches and we're not
always going to do it right but from

312
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,080
here on

313
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,010
I hope that I can how to coming out of
icon

314
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,550
I'd like every single one of you to be a
member the PSF

315
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,220
by the end of the year I'd like to have
30,000 members

316
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:21,130
at the PSF worldwide or even more
because Dad is true that the community

317
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,840
is about

318
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,050
so we can support each other we can
empower each other and we can truly

319
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,950
represent be representative I'll this
community

320
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,550
in all in in all its diversity thank you
