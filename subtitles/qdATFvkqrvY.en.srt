00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:14,719
make

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,210
nom Gartner 1

3
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,300
are you %ah get so we have

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,239
we have two very exciting talks we have
two arm hardware

5
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:28,509
our talks in a row in this room so you
you probably wanna

6
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:31,949
stick around are and starting this blog
we have

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,180
opera some homes I with his stock
lending art technology like

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,820
bite them for an active in real time LED
insulations

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:46,820
let's give a hand to present right lol
thanks for coming out

10
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,390
term means Preston I do few Python thing
they do some cloudy things

11
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,410
and I have sort of a closeted artistic
side that I'm getting some love you have

12
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,190
some interest in in Arden created and
actually argue that almost everyone here

13
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,490
icon is is a creative person because
code ultimately is

14
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:12,270
is a creative process so the Wyoming
antibodies in in the answer super simple

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,420
it's because for

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,250
forever we've been fascinated by twinkly
lights were there looking at the night

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,080
sky

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,250
staring at firefight in a forest
assertive

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,150
doing an awning at fireworks in the sky
and

20
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,900
in working with LED's has a lot of parts
and so when I'm gonna really try to do

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,030
is give a full stack overview

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,520
up all the layers here and go all the
way from electrons to motions

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,310
talk about LED at the material the
controller hardware in San the

24
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,909
integrated circuitry involved

25
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,560
interfaces and protocols that are
required to speak to these devices

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,560
summer software libraries that can be
used and finally some creative design

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,360
pattern so it's

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,060
it's quite a full stack on so conduct
dive right in

29
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,320
LED light emitting diode I'm guessing
everyone can understand what the light

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,149
and meeting part is by default here so
I'll talk just very briefly about what

31
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,090
diet is

32
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,149
that essentially is a Tulare sandwich

33
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:09,269
to semiconductor materials were 1/2 is
doped in a way that it is

34
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:12,989
as an excessive liked runs and the other
side is dope the way it has sort of a

35
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,549
shortage electrons is a cold electron
holes

36
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:18,850
and this result in a structure where
current can really only

37
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,640
flow in one direction for the Houston
circuits to act as for check valves

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,450
and in the case of light emitting diode
what happens is when electron dropped

39
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,580
into a hole it goes from higher energy
state to lower energy state and releases

40
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:30,830
a

41
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,370
a vote on which we can see is visible
light and

42
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,819
so we're many view from the witness
former up LED this is kinda blinky light

43
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,910
the US start of it as a hardware project
I just wish other

44
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,010
LED materialists or that one small
square and for

45
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,540
for more creative purposes were
interested in RGB LED's and these are in

46
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,030
fact

47
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,610
three separate LED's closely put
together into a package like this work

48
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,370
each of these have been chemically set
up to nearly the red green or blue light

49
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,849
in this case it's in what's called a
50-50 package which just means that the

50
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,260
five no nearby five millimeter square

51
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,560
and by having them this close together
when you apply different amount of power

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,840
that you took the red green and blue
LED's

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,519
the colors blend in we can perceive it
as a as a full spectrum

54
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,190
when you start working with LED is one
of the terms you come

55
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,489
come across really quickly as smart
verses done LED's and a dumb LED is

56
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:22,150
simply

57
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,299
one of these LED packages has no logic
circuitry involved it's just you apply

58
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,640
voltages and and they emit light and if
you have a stripper have done LED's

59
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,049
when you play voltage and you make
purple all the LED's are the same color

60
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,040
at the same time

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,150
smart LED's involve some sort of logic
circuitry insists

62
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,170
the Sumter integrated ship along the
along the way

63
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,769
that allows it to receive a data
protocol

64
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,409
and each light along the strip can be

65
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:56,959
individually controlled as its own color
on brightness et cetera

66
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,280
and they've actually now gotten to the
point where they're building these

67
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,180
integrated circuits directly into the
LED package

68
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,340
so so these things require these sort of
protocols and there's a variety of them

69
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,110
but a and before going into that they
these packages come in she different

70
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,049
shapes and sizes

71
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:19,390
so there's some varieties here where
there are more than one

72
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,740
LED per control chip so this

73
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,580
unit of control is called a pic so often
called an LED pixel

74
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,360
nan an LED pixel may have more than one
LED in the package the date they come in

75
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,210
a variety of forms but the unit have
control is called a pixel

76
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,020
and the datatypes take take tend to be
served

77
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,700
specialized very high clock rate serial
formats

78
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,219
that am essentially boiled down to an
array of bytes

79
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:50,330
and each of these chips will simply take
off pop off

80
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,479
three bites use it for our GNP but for
the remaining bite and then for them

81
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,000
down the line to the each

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,050
pixel along the chip doesn't really know
that it's pixel number five it just

83
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,930
simply part of tree by 10:40 remaining

84
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,200
and these protocols while they very they
are all very high clock rate very

85
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,159
precision timing or into protocols and
they're not something that a

86
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:15,560
sort of kernel-based operating system
based program can generate reliably

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,300
you need something that's going to
maintain really high

88
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,719
fidelity in the timing and so what what
kinda things can use to

89
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:27,399
to create the signals we can you heard
me know and there's really actually

90
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,250
fantastic art Mina library called

91
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,830
fast LED but limitations barred windows
are that

92
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,029
you know there's a limit to how many of
these people you can actually connect to

93
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,550
one at one time

94
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,909
and center here Pike on I just have to
be a loss are you can't really

95
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,270
effectively use

96
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,990
bite on directly on it we know so what
what's or some other choices there

97
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,700
and in in the do yourself hard disk
space there's a these are kinda the two

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,570
main players there there's varieties up
them but these

99
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,529
these manufactures and what these boards
do is they take as an input

100
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:01,320
a standard lighting protocol which will
talk about the second

101
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,870
and they have embedded in their own
circuitry

102
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,360
I'm in there from where the ability to
translate into the whole range of the

103
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,909
different

104
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:13,709
pixel specific timings and formats and
they have enough capacity to allow you

105
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,339
to plug in many other these pixels

106
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:21,289
so this is the kinda bored but that you
of news and I i have one up here they'll

107
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:25,750
demo democrat the morning so I said
these take a a lighting protocol

108
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,099
input and so to talk a little bit about
that I have to tell you about tnx

109
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:35,260
on actually not that the attacks this is
is DMX 512

110
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,599
and its and it's the lighting protocol
that was initially established for a

111
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,050
theater lighting so

112
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,399
real quick at their history is initially
all the best eight tonight in theaters

113
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:44,919
use have

114
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,750
manual de Mures that we read a bit from
the stage in that country become a

115
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,990
painful so

116
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,770
they initially created DC motors that
would turn the dimmers and control the

117
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,959
DC motors from the back to the house

118
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,599
and that was sort of cumbersome so
eventually became serialize

119
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:04,640
into sparkled call DMX 512 and it's able
to address 512 individual

120
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,680
channels have data in this in the SERPs
slots

121
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,409
a its lot and and initially I'm sure
this is this is called one universe 512

122
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:15,839
channels called one university a max

123
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,599
because I'm sure what are the cliche
have 512 channels ass has to be enough

124
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,860
for anyone right now and can any more
than five earned

125
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,709
chance what things grew things got more
complex and they didn't so

126
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,190
eventually they're you have to run
multiple have surface

127
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,849
serial cable to control more than 512
channels

128
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:35,890
for the evolution of the protocol move
towards wrapping these

129
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,959
data packet into Ethernet packets

130
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,149
as a very catchy name you 1.3 one as the
standard in the lighting industry now

131
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:43,969
for sending

132
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:47,669
DMX over Ethernet and it is in fact

133
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:51,459
this protocol that has now become the
most common way of controlling

134
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,870
the lighting circuitry well thats that's
a really now that we're talking about

135
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,979
even that we can start talking about
software that runs

136
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,839
in a familiar turf operating system
environment

137
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,500
not talk about that a there's a lot I
just

138
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,800
softer out there that's very specific
and as monolithic in it it simply

139
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,260
handles

140
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:16,320
the rendering up data and then the
translation of that data into a protocol

141
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,349
on if you're interested in quickly
hacking on something that's

142
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,550
that's not too interesting you might you
party more interesting looking at

143
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,140
something that allows you to use

144
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,360
a library that takes data and does the
conversion

145
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,440
for you and so

146
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,529
processor up Python programmers we want
to be leveraged something like an

147
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,839
interface library that handles all the

148
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,779
specific protocol format we just want to
give it an array of values

149
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:45,430
on would just give credit there's a
project called open leading architecture

150
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,910
its through the Swiss Army Knife
lighting protocols

151
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,090
tools it will you can get a data has
great python bindings and it will render

152
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,200
it out to you

153
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,300
any of the various hardware types out
there on

154
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,530
and it's very flexible but its it kinda
kitchen sink

155
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,260
that heavyweight and for for a while
until recently was hard to get to run on

156
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,180
something like a Raspberry Pi so

157
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,820
I went ahead and Rhoda a pure Python
implementation a minimalist input

158
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,030
implementation just that you won 3-1
protocol

159
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,560
in Python but there but they're both

160
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,570
perfectly usable now that layer

161
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,840
the software takes care of talking to
the hardware but it's not

162
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,600
where the creative process happens and
so when we look at the side of software

163
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,910
that is user focus user

164
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,310
sorta purpose there's a sense of
american talk about in the theater

165
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,150
industry

166
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,230
that's mostly around on scenes switching
scenes

167
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,890
a lot of the innovation in dynamic
displays has come from that the

168
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,620
Christmas lighting folks

169
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,830
here they want to do the crazy animated
Christmas light shows

170
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,390
and for a long time before there were
RGB pixels to work with

171
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,850
you still at a relatively small number
of channels to work within you end up

172
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,280
with a program

173
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,300
that often we just take the project
dividing time into slices

174
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,610
31 row is one of your channels and then
you slice it into columns and you simply

175
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,800
address

176
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,780
a leveller value in each square the grid

177
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,180
but when you start to get many many many
channels kinda

178
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,270
individually filling in all these boxes
is pretty tedious

179
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,440
another approach to the current to stay
Dr is

180
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,470
is DJ matrices you know these big
two-dimensional matrices that are not

181
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,130
quote in

182
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,220
and those kind of things and there's
very expensive you noticed several

183
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,630
thousand dollars to to use

184
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,630
test takes on a screen saver and Adrian
and projected onto a 2d matrix

185
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:42,310
so stunning run in 2010 I started
thinking about a wave

186
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,620
experimenting with another model of
taking a

187
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,940
an abstraction three three layers that
inputs

188
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,960
elements and outputs where the input
would be sorta events that happen

189
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,060
from some sort of device input device or
other sort of I'll

190
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,920
these would trigger actions in elements
would

191
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,120
take care rendering the data over time
and then ship it out

192
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,130
output in this library is called bird
fish

193
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,010
it on it's really just my East certain
testbed sketch pad for experimenting

194
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,240
with some the stuff you've got what a
rough edges

195
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,010
it's really a classic terminally pre
alpha psi project

196
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,580
so this is this is minutes it's what I
use for the demoss here but it's now

197
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,720
down

198
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,020
you know i win I wouldn't go around
Disney it shows light on it

199
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,980
I talked about the input so we'll start
there am

200
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,080
in a vent really in a sense falls into
two categories: either to trigger event

201
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,740
in a trigger event is you you can think
about is simply

202
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,170
a light switch on of on of and

203
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,200
these on of events occur over time

204
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,230
and each channel in your lighting system

205
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,090
can have its own Series event see you
get the sort of player piano

206
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,570
look to it and this a

207
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,070
player piano analogy is not without some

208
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,430
well you'll see impact later in the
sense that music

209
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,660
I've I've learned a lot from what
electronic music has done

210
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,110
around rendering a fax in real time with
sound

211
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,290
a lot applies to music to trigger
venture one type of thing these are very

212
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,620
discreet on of events and then the other
type up at the end are

213
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,960
were caught napping dance in the end and
long to this is it if you think I've

214
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,350
turning a dial

215
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:31,270
these are values a change there you know
in a very varied way over time

216
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,150
so the overall model looks a little
something like this you have a vents

217
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,790
that are coming in at the time I need a
trigger a map these

218
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,010
on a pencil and onto these

219
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,460
elements in the elements our code
objects that respond to

220
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,200
triggers triggers on trigger of and its
these objects to take care

221
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,310
generating data overtime and end up
resulting in sort of a torrent updated

222
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,270
because

223
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,840
the hardware itself only cares about an
instantaneous value but get any sort of

224
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,430
an effect over time

225
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,600
you need to continuously changing
streams have

226
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,880
up data to get the hard way to do
anything interesting

227
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,279
on in terms of the actual hardware to
create

228
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,670
the events I've Iveco use primarily to
one is MIDI which is

229
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,640
what electronic musical instrument use
its alder

230
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,779
army its it's pretty reliable but it
does it's limited to

231
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,980
7 did values are 0 to 127

232
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,090
I'm 16 channels per sorta minibus

233
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,430
and in they often involves a lot about
OS specific

234
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,690
am driver level stuff too can become a
pain to work with

235
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,950
open some controls a bit more modern at
UTPB East

236
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,760
on use it for the demo today because
wireless on live demos pretty painful

237
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,360
but

238
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,540
on and is very flexible that how you
specify the value

239
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,760
so this graphic is actually about other
program called touch OSCE for Iowa's

240
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,800
they have an Android version as well and
what it does is it allows you to sort of

241
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,920
give a a you are I essentially to some
value want

242
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,120
and and give you either floating point
values for any range of these controls

243
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,400
or you can set a minimum and maximum so
very flexible gives you that serve rock

244
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,060
controller input

245
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,089
you can then turn into something up your
own choosing

246
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:28,600
alright let's get into a a little bit if
actual pipe on now and some koto

247
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,150
um essentially this is the minimal
starting point for some sort of

248
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:39,290
british-based light show light show
itself is the object that takes care

249
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,890
rendering the main event loop its the
and primary orchestration

250
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,210
object in in this am you then

251
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,920
bring in a dispatcher for the event
something that listening to input

252
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,980
hardware

253
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,750
and sending triggers to the specific
light elements themselves

254
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,880
and then finally need some output where
the day to get sent to

255
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,050
to be turned into hardware actual events
for the

256
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,560
for the lights themselves the next step
is to actually create

257
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,570
a light element this is the thing that
takes triggers as inputs

258
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,520
and renders out data every frame as far
as what it should do

259
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,350
so receive the trigger on it says start
sending

260
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,830
channel date out lights trigger of stop
sending channel data out to the lights

261
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,300
you then have to kind of wire up some in
these pieces you get a

262
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,330
you have to add the output network to
the show so it knows about you at the

263
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,460
element to the show so it knows about it

264
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,870
and then finally here at the bottom you
you tell the

265
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,089
MIDI instrument in this case I'm using a
a Nana pad controller that

266
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:47,210
this button which gives me denote 49

267
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,810
I didn't decide that that's just the way
the hardware is built this is the thing

268
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,510
that should be connected to

269
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,800
that binding element

270
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm so if the demigods will and then
finally we go ahead we start the

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,960
dispatcher

272
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,589
the MIDI listener runs in its own thread
the show is a blocking

273
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,830
you know run loop and

274
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,510
will see now if I can get this to

275
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:17,230
I've had some issues with my USB based

276
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,370
and the democrats are not working with
me

277
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:27,180
today so my backup is video

278
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,690
I can show you what this would look like
working

279
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,800
it was earlier

280
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,589
so you touch the button and you get the
light comes on

281
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:42,430
release button because of on that enough
itself is not very

282
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,529
creative so the next step really is to
look at

283
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:51,290
what can be done around giving things a
more organic feel

284
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,570
things in nature don't stopped and

285
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,080
start and stop very suddenly like that
and so the people who

286
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,050
first I work with electronic music
realize too that musical instruments

287
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,820
have

288
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,589
to have a new russia and sound in things
come months of planning of softly

289
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,439
on so there's a concept in in
sympathizers called

290
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,679
a an attack decay sustain release and
love and if you think about what the

291
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,049
volume up an instrument is as you hit a
key on a keyboard

292
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:21,860
things can come on gradually reach a
peak decay

293
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,870
sustain for some time and then when you
let go of the key in a piano the

294
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,350
cleaning up the pedal down

295
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,140
the sound falls off so we can use that
same concept

296
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:37,140
on in in lighting amplitude

297
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,800
up I'm actually without a border

298
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,260
so this is to show that and element
doesn't have to be a single light an

299
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,420
element can be a group of lights

300
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,590
and that the trigger in this case is
still a single trigger but in our fax

301
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,730
a whole group of lights

302
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,880
this is the demo to show what happens if
you have a an envelope so in this case

303
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,490
there's still a single

304
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,690
simple trigger trigger on trigger are

305
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,809
but the lighting element is handling the
rendering of the fading on

306
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:15,350
fading of overtime without it being
required from the control side and so it

307
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,929
still rendering 40 frames per second
worth

308
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:25,929
have control data

309
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:36,640
and the same idea can be applied to a
array of flights where the

310
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,150
behavior this element is called a light
chase

311
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,000
so that the behavior over time which
light in arrays let

312
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,180
is being determined by the light element
the trigger itself is still

313
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,610
just a simple on/off but in this case
we're getting to add

314
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:59,010
serve a slightly more complex layered on

315
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,930
the other thing when you get to these

316
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,100
this idea them lips is that animation
has

317
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,890
always brought in this concept of
twinning element so what we know I'm

318
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,330
into something that tends to

319
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,860
easy in easy out and the idea is to have
non linear motion

320
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,310
gives a a electronic

321
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,980
device a more natural and interesting
creative team or

322
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,220
creative flexibility so if you had
simple animations in a in a 3d animated

323
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,210
movie that moved

324
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,800
only linearly and stopped they wouldn't
look very interesting so you can apply

325
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,510
a range of these creative curves not
only to

326
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:43,810
brightness or motion but you can apply
them to things like

327
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:47,900
changed the rate of change of color the
rate of change in saturation

328
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,200
am the rate of change two things I want
in seeking create these

329
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,730
envelopes have changed over time and
build them as attributes have the

330
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,100
behaviour wannabes lighting elements

331
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,480
and I have more great times

332
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,130
love to show you but and

333
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,560
believe that once my once my hardware is
falling down it's fallen down

334
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,770
yep I miss my

335
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,830
my Mac Book to have a hard wired
Ethernet port alright so

336
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,080
not not to dwell on that here's just
some

337
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,110
examples have some other sort of
nonlinearity that you can get

338
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,310
so you can see a sort of a spray pattern
where

339
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:39,090
a essentially the velocity is changing
over time slowing down

340
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:46,090
that's one a fact

341
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,340
mister show some elasticity in the
motion where there's a will spring back

342
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,600
and it also shows

343
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,419
there's another envelope applied to the
edges up that light curve

344
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:02,539
the way it fade off from the bright
point in the center to the edges gives

345
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:03,039
it a

346
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,399
serve soft edges there's even a further
check in this demo where I have sort of

347
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,940
sub-pixel anti-aliasing so that the

348
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,649
center point out that motion is not
lockstep to a single

349
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:20,480
point and

350
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:27,179
just one more the server bounce motion

351
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:32,620
so the key is to remember that we
started with the simple LED material and

352
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,070
we're

353
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,630
working with hardware that isn't
completely dumb about

354
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,980
what'd renders out and intend to the
lighting hardware

355
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,549
it just requires an instantaneous value
to give a certain brightness

356
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:48,529
anything that looks like behavior has to
come from the software itself

357
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:53,110
and that sort of but I was looking at in
terms trying to build a toolkit for

358
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,200
building that's kinda

359
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,769
fax and in a way that could be reactor
have

360
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:04,169
worked within a real time that isn't
being pre-rendered don't see

361
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:09,510
so actually have because my demos have
failed I have one more

362
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,380
bonus material I will go into and that
is

363
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,940
around the idea of I've adapted frame
rate so I talked about

364
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,860
to get something to look like motion you
need to have the least ten to twelve

365
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,049
frames per second and that looks kinda
jittery if you've ever worked with the

366
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:26,960
books it sort of

367
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,149
flip books or maybe in the 10 frames per
second rate

368
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,720
to get something more fluid I mean if
you're a video game person you know you

369
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,419
want those

370
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,919
super high frame rates II shoot for
around 40 frames per second

371
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,630
the problem is that depending on how
complex the effects are and how many

372
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,659
other than you're trying to render in
real time that can be taxing on

373
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:50,669
on the CPU so the goal is how can you
come up with a way of consistently

374
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,590
delivering

375
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,789
the expected a fact to

376
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:59,240
and never be synchronized a certain
point I'm your frame start taking longer

377
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,039
to render

378
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:04,450
so in this case this is the ideal
scenario every every frame up these 20

379
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,450
frames across one second are being

380
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,559
evenly calculated and we and the color
fade each of these dart is sort of like

381
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,690
represents a a light and an array the
yellow lights represent for these

382
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,889
chasers across

383
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:20,370
went back in and that the color fade the
problem is that

384
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,620
if one is free and takes a while we
still want to and

385
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,690
at the exact same place at one second
time

386
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,190
and so the idea is to come up with her
this adaptive loop where

387
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,130
at the beginning of each loop I I
anticipate what's the

388
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,610
next expected frame in time frame
catlett all the values

389
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,679
and if I and done ahead of time I can
just sit around waiting ship the date of

390
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:46,100
and then begin the next loop

391
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,740
however five I'm overdue and I've missed
the mark

392
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,510
I can reduce the frame rate so that the
next frame I calculate I'm giving myself

393
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,139
more time to calculate

394
00:23:56,139 --> 00:24:01,520
and and sort of give your feedback to
what the frame rate is at any given time

395
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,309
in this kinda

396
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:05,669
I'd I honestly don't know how other
games are other systems do it is

397
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,929
something I was kind of just came up
with to address my challenge here

398
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:12,850
and the result is something that looks
like this where we now have taken

399
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,139
16 frames to do an incentive 20

400
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:20,399
and a couple others frames have become
taken longer to render but

401
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:24,539
end result is that the end up one second
we still are where we

402
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:28,690
expect to be in the overall affect arm

403
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,360
that is what I have I am

404
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,350
so go forth and be creative and

405
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,059
we certainly have some time for
questions in and if you want to chase me

406
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,010
down I can try and reboot this demo on

407
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,559
and see if we can get see if we can get
a gun but non

408
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:52,559
not to worry about thank you

409
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:56,549
so take a person

410
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,210
and if you have some questions please
job form a line here in the mike

411
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:07,210
and and state your question spur stuff

412
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,140
we talk it's good to see offer you
brought this you know

413
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,580
as a medium on

414
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,910
obviously it's has the hardware
component on

415
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,350
but the idea like DJ is really cool
where'd you get starters for is like

416
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,790
equipment you know going

417
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,049
things and yeah I mean

418
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:39,610
the availability of that the smart
pixels is

419
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,780
is become better used to be I I got a
lot of my actual lights from China

420
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,410
director to only bother expresso one of
those types of places but

421
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,400
that the hardest boards available
they're pretty cheap you can actually

422
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,360
buy the risk it to buy them assembled

423
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,030
and then a number sorta spark fun in a
data type place stores

424
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:03,220
have some in the picture now but you you
really can't play with the software

425
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,360
until you have at least

426
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,380
some the hardware because the softer by
itself is pretty boring

427
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,299
higher

428
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:16,600
pretty on

429
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,630
I'm just wondering on there are other

430
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,710
their frameworks that seem wells needed
for this kind of thing

431
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,200
namely processing which connects to a
lot of different

432
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,580
hardwares and software owns

433
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,240
and so I'm just wondering year on

434
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,270
you think there's any particular
advantages

435
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,000
choosing hi time for an application like
this

436
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,429
and where its strengths my why

437
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:50,270
yeah I mean I would say that

438
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:55,210
against processing there is no
particular advantage accept that

439
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,549
I'm eitan Eastern its my by two

440
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:02,760
choice in and I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna really try to claim it better

441
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,210
I think one of the strengths hitman has
in many of the domains that

442
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,510
might be used is that there are lots and
lotsa

443
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,690
resources out there for connecting other
things

444
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,440
into it so there are lots of ways to
integrate

445
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,020
you know our web server duper there's
just lots of

446
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,770
that the Brett through the pipe on you
can ok system

447
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,150
allows you to hi this part delighting

448
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,650
system into anything else that Python

449
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,690
might be connected to and leverage and
as leverage to

450
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,480
the brat that the ecosystem as far as
the actual rendering a fax

451
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,730
you know processing is phenomenal I know
people done amazing things on our

452
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:51,730
cleaners with processing

453
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,150
right thank you
