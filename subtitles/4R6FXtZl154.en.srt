1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,100
right well let's go ahead in

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,490
get started so I name is Cedric is

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,009
has been awhile bomb too too long time
did you do the Python community

4
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,420
I she created the pike and poster
session she created the

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,949
pie cut education summit and she is
tired

6
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,100
people had a program in Python in and
write your contacts

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,920
and she speaks in large both up icon and
her experiences where gender transition

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,230
in the tech community

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,179
and she is going to be talking with us
today about farewell and welcome home a

10
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,739
python in two genders

11
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:39,739
please welcome Mary cedar

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,540
so my card

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,000
okay I'll so I want to start with the
disclaimer

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,970
I am basically what I'm going to be
talking about is based on my experiences

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,290
in my observations there could be two
reasons for this:

16
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,500
one of them is maybe a little bit of a
weasel in that

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,960
you can't call BS on this this is my
life the

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,500
other thing is that I want to make it
clear that I cannot speak for

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,690
all all transgender people I cannot
speak for all trans women

20
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,470
I cannot speak for all white late middle
age trans women from the Chicago area

21
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,619
are I can really only speak for myself
this is an important point because

22
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,750
up marginalized groups people tend to
assume

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,240
that one of them represents all of them
and that's just not true

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,729
are so this

25
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,300
is in fact a very difficult talk for me
to give

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,060
in its very weird for me to be in this
situation

27
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,800
I have been teaching in speaking for
decades normally

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,280
I the back of an envelope in five
minutes I'm good to talk for

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,289
hours ask my former students

30
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:10,360
arms so this in fact that I've told my
story a few times now and it gets harder

31
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,600
I every time I think party that is that
in spite

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,510
above the disclaimer I just gave you I'm
afraid that people

33
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,660
think I am speaking for a lot of other
people I'm really scared screwing it up

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,000
I the other thing though is this quote
from Laverne Cox

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,630
lover in is a transgender actress who
stars

36
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,930
on orange is the new black the Netflix
series she's

37
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,349
also quickly becoming one of the leading

38
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,920
%uh spokespeople for the transgender
community this is both the reason why

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,160
I'm scared and this is the mantra that
I've been clinging to

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,170
in order to go through with this hit is
revolutionary

41
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,500
for any trans person to choose to be
seen

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,990
invisible in a world that tells us we
should not exist

43
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,209
so this is in fact my revolutionary act

44
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,640
and parted my story is in fact the story
of the world telling me

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,760
all of my life that I should not but I
cannot exist

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,849
so to start a long time ago and some of
my friends made fun of me starting back

47
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:13,489
this far

48
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,959
are I was born in a small town in
nebraska in the country doctor declared

49
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,189
with great confidence

50
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:23,549
it's a boy unfortunately he was wrong

51
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,890
in fact I was transgender and what this
means if you're not familiar with it

52
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,280
is that some time before I was born
something very essential

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,230
in the the way that my brain works was
set to female rather than being ill

54
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,719
I I try to stay up to date on the
literature and things like that up but

55
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,450
in fact

56
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,780
their is no clear explanation love this
at this point there are clearly genetic

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,620
factors

58
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,590
they're also clearly epigenetic factors
timing's a poor man's

59
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,430
various things but we don't know what
causes it there are probably more

60
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,510
trouble causes

61
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,450
and in a very important way it doesn't
matter

62
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,569
what military's is that I never chose

63
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:12,909
to be transgender I never chose to be
born

64
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:17,799
with email body and a female breen mind
whatever it is

65
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,820
are I always just was

66
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,870
now as you might imagine

67
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,440
I even now with this is a hard thing I
in those days in that time

68
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,970
this left me fairly confused I knew that
things were

69
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,310
rate I also learned very quickly through

70
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,380
fairly pervasive gender policing that

71
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,840
I could never be a girl or with the
girls are like the girls

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,990
not only that but I learned very very
quickly and

73
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,990
and I'm talking about back 45

74
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,389
I could never even talk about it never

75
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:57,240
never no one can know that's so

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,389
you can imagine I was really confused I
until

77
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,700
eventually I N O when puberty hit this
became a very

78
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,740
urgent issue in at about that time our
family got

79
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,990
I Look magazine this was in are january
of nineteen seventy which shows you how

80
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,570
freaking

81
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,890
all I am and here with Steve McQueen's
mucho face smeared across the cover

82
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:23,690
with an appeal to the president this
would be richard milhouse nixon

83
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,910
I to unite the country there was also an
article on this new

84
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,490
bizarre freaking weird phenomenon I
transsexuals male or female

85
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,330
I read that article and I saw myself in
its secured the hell hath me

86
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,650
I found that are all transsexuals were
deeply troubled people

87
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,320
who have to leave extraordinarily
complicated lives

88
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,640
if you read this article closely you
will find that they are deeply troubled

89
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,890
people because they are almost always

90
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,970
on able to get treatment

91
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,050
and they live extraordinarily
complicated lives

92
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,550
because if they do get treatment they
pretty much in

93
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,010
as a price getting treatment they have
to enter what I call the trans witness

94
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,490
protection program

95
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,800
that is in that day this was actually
part of the medical protocol

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,420
if you wanted to undergo any sort of
treatment for are being transgender

97
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,570
you needed to goes still as we say give
up

98
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,530
all connections to your former life no
one bust ever know

99
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,720
or something horrible will happen to you

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,820
this made quite an impression on me as a
as it I

101
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,640
a very young teenager I in fact it's
interesting when I ran across this

102
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,470
article online about nine months ago

103
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,650
after four decades I still had a whole
paragraph served is committed to memory

104
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,750
for beat 'em

105
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,490
%uh so faced with this information I did

106
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,530
I made the sordid rational adult
decision that any thirteen-year-old with

107
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,310
absolutely no one to talk to did

108
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,890
I decided is to just not me I would just
not let it happen

109
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,320
I wasn't this buried that's it no
problem

110
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,780
I am and so I'm

111
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,400
I went in now I eat struggle to fit in
as a boy

112
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,580
and what I mean by this in retrospect I
can see is that

113
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,170
I really wasn't comfortable trying to be

114
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,450
a member %uh a group of boys just was
never meet

115
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,320
I as a very mention there was no chance
that I was going to fit in with the

116
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,960
girls

117
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,110
that was right out so in fact the only
third way open to me

118
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,010
was with the handful of people who are
certain into science and doing things

119
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,160
like that

120
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,810
now that's not to say for geeky your
transgender cuz that's clearly not true

121
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,300
but in fact we did have boys and girls
there

122
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,390
there were a lot fewer even in that time
a lot fewer above the sordid

123
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,450
gender policing and episodes I

124
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,930
the what you would get normally so this
was a way to survive in a way

125
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,140
it was also very interesting I mean for
us in those days

126
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,260
I'm the technology that was accessible
to us was

127
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:05,050
astronomy and telescopes how we ordered
lenses made telescopes I'm

128
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,680
ground a mir's for reflect urs we did
all that stuff

129
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,390
it made us very very very strange kids

130
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:18,390
I in central Nebraska back in that day
but at least they understood what we

131
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,890
were we were geeks and nerds and that
was

132
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,960
well wasn't really great but OK I in
fact we're is so weird that we would end

133
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,000
up in the newspaper from time to time

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,430
are wanna my friends joked that must've
been a slow news day trust me

135
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,300
central Nebraska in those days pretty
much every day was a slow news day

136
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,140
so their am on the right with my good
friend Dave

137
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,159
we're still friends to this day %ah and

138
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,950
by the EC long noted the bottom sister
people

139
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,390
are always very interested in before is
an after his with transgender people

140
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,680
art what it used to look like what's
your you'll be more that really gets

141
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,209
going

142
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:01,660
iight and for transgender people in
general this is fairly uncomfortable

143
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,360
I just wanna admit I am no exception to
that these are not comfortable things

144
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,519
for me to show you

145
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,029
so I was geeky kid

146
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,890
I went on to be geeky teenager and to be
geeky young adult and then a geeky adult

147
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,579
I got a PhD in Greek and Latin
literature

148
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:25,820
then huh along the way in a story that's
really too complicated for happy hour

149
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,630
talk

150
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,400
I ended up switching from being are a
Latin teacher

151
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,490
to a school Technology Director

152
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,410
software developer I teacher

153
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,230
I chief d/b/a are pretty much everything

154
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,690
so I ended up doing a live programming
starting in the ER

155
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,740
late eighties I programmed in artsy in
Pascal

156
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,730
I in Visual Basic I am ashamed to say
it's my only option for something don't

157
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,520
judge me

158
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,730
II did various things like that along
the way actually

159
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,220
open source came around and I thought
this was just great stuff

160
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,060
arm I i switched to Linux I switch the
school's servers the Linux

161
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,250
that's the great thing about being the
technology director nobody can stop you

162
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,490
ice started a lug I am

163
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,180
I actually at a Linux world and Nathan
our kind trying to decide it was 2000 or

164
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,520
2001

165
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,960
I learn Python so in fact

166
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,190
at least a few love you may have met
this guy here

167
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,050
he doesn't work here anymore so

168
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,060
I became involved in the Python
community fairly early on

169
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,120
the matter-of-fact I think it was with
the in

170
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,360
three or four weeks %uh learning Python
that we were teaching it

171
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,970
are two ninth graders at the school I
was at

172
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,640
that's because the alternative would
have been teaching them something like

173
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,529
Java and that just made me cry

174
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:57,150
I and it worked really well I ended up
teaching this to other teachers at state

175
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,560
national things

176
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,870
I'm I taught this to people at Lenox
mass

177
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,520
I it's a story that other people have to
tell to once we got started we really

178
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,870
wouldn't shut up

179
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,960
arm I E started speaking fairly early on

180
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,250
again on Ethan you're going to give a
talk at the first

181
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,490
up icon that really was a pike on back
in 2003 we were just talking about that

182
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,490
I I talked it some arm state and
national

183
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,540
our computer educators things I just
felt tonight used to do kind of a road

184
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,810
show to the National

185
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:34,320
educational computer coordinators
convention um

186
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,730
I did things like that I ended up doing
some writing

187
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,250
up my writing career was a little bit
peculiar I went from being the humor

188
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,800
columnist for a dog training magazine

189
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,580
I to working on I'm not making that up
II was on the cover once

190
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,520
arm cell %uh to arm

191
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,450
actually working on a couple attack but
projects are most recently I did the

192
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,740
second edition adequate python book

193
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,120
are which sells well enough thank God I
actually get a little money for it so I

194
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,620
invite you to help that

195
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,740
arm I E at

196
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,180
made the mistake I've saying to Steve
Holden when he was such a rough the PSF

197
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,580
you know him there's anything I can ever
do

198
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,850
and before I really even got that
finished

199
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,820
I he said you like really like a poster
session up icon

200
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,720
okay I'd honestly never even seen a
poster session but the man had spoken so

201
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,430
we figured out how to do that

202
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,440
are and through some twisted events that
I haven't quite found them

203
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,350
I ended up in the Python Software
Foundation so

204
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,900
basically I was getting a lot from the
Python community this was something that

205
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,350
I liked a lot

206
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,290
I think are you know Brett summed it up
for a lot of us out when he said he came

207
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,570
for the language in stayed for the
community

208
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,320
iight this was really a good thing for
me

209
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,850
the problem was I was still
transgendered

210
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,380
and it's hard to describe but this is
like the whole phrase

211
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,029
born in the wrong body you're trapped in
the wrong body is something made up

212
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,970
by a journalist doesn't describe my
experience certainly

213
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,529
instead the best analogy that I've been
able to come up with so far

214
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:16,330
is if you know you really tired and you
know you've got a really long day the

215
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,500
next day

216
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,680
and you can't sleep and you lie in bed
and you think about

217
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,240
how you need sleep than you think about
how you're wasting the time

218
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,860
you should be sleeping thinking about
how you need sleep when you think about

219
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,440
how you got to think about needing sleep
use to sleep

220
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,320
and then you're back to thinking about
how much needed sleep and you sir go

221
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,140
through that for what

222
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,240
it's like that every our every day when
you

223
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,310
for me at least it was when you
transgender I think that gender

224
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,810
I think about how much time wasting
thinking about gender thing about I'm

225
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,470
not gonna

226
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,050
you back it just continually grinds away
at you

227
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,040
so I started telling myself if I could
just hold on until I died

228
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,040
it would be okay the problem is I wasn't
dying fast enough

229
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,029
I and in fact people think this is maybe
me being a drama queen or something

230
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:03,180
forty-one percent of transgender people
attempt to kill themselves

231
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,190
this is just a fact because almost every
trans person I've talked to

232
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,750
has come to this point with the only way
this can and is when I die

233
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,060
that's not a generalization about
transgender people particularly by the

234
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,380
way that's a generalization about how
you're treated

235
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,850
so this led me to

236
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,890
too stupid to think have some weird
things and I started thinking that the

237
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,570
only thing that I could do

238
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,300
was embrace my truth and you notice they
say my truth because the truth that

239
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,990
society had been telling me

240
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,200
or the world had been telling me was
that I couldn't exist

241
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,750
and I decided that to do that

242
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,200
would probably mean giving up everything
remember back at thirteen I had absorbed

243
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,850
this into my brain

244
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,390
that the only way you're going to get
out if this was to basically leave

245
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,210
everything

246
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,770
and this was a very painful thing to
think about but like a lot of trans

247
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,160
people had come to the point where

248
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,060
even if I lost everything that was fine
so

249
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,839
I E started to think about other
alternatives here

250
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,260
arm I had toyed with the idea of doing
the education summit

251
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,930
as a farewell thing to the community I
would do it and then disappear

252
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,790
going to the prions witness protection
program the only problem was

253
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,339
actually started accelerating the peace
my transition because well

254
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:22,930
it was just such a freak relief to start
moving in that direction

255
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:27,450
iight that that wouldn't work so I
actually thought about

256
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,600
what was for me harking back to learn
Cox a very revolutionary

257
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,029
night idea what if I just did it and was
open about it

258
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,250
up first thing I looked at codes of
conduct

259
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,360
I look for specifics what happens to me
if there is

260
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,600
a problem if I am harassed this was
important to me

261
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,980
other thing I did was they started
telling a few people I Jesse Noller

262
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,210
a V alaska some people I would work with
them high con- and they were all pretty

263
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,140
cool with the idea

264
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,080
and the more I talked about it the more
I decided that I would go ahead and take

265
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,140
that chance

266
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,149
so I did I started by teaching at some

267
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:07,089
Python workshops for women I i spoke to
conferences

268
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:11,649
went icon it was good the education
summit was fine

269
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:14,980
okay some other people I work with an
organizing it were a little bit confused

270
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,440
when the names on the emails change
typology I

271
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,500
up but in general it went pretty well
arm

272
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,070
in fact the more open I was the easier
it was on it was for me

273
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,440
because I didn't have to worry about
being outed it was easier for other

274
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
people because

275
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,850
they certainly know what to expect at
the other interesting sidelight

276
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,610
is that when I told people they
sometimes felt an obligation to share

277
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,420
some deep dark secret about themselves
like i cud

278
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,620
prompt the man they had it to answer
back I'm

279
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,620
cell my takeaway here is that

280
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,910
we talk a lot about diversity and that's
real

281
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,870
soul but we should be ending on this
point except that

282
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,180
I'm I'm a contrary in in my old age

283
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,120
%uh so it is not quite all rainbows and
unicorns

284
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,339
or as you might put it this is kinda
common in social justice state circles

285
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:02,959
right now

286
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,760
we don't get a cookie we the Python
community quite yet

287
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,149
um I want to tell you a little bit about
the realities that remain

288
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:14,449
I am almost always the only openly trans
person in

289
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,529
in the room and we talked a little bit
last night the transmit up about how

290
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:18,750
weird it is to actually

291
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,470
be in the company of many other trans
people all in the same place school

292
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,829
that's weird arm and

293
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,380
by openly trans UK government suggests
that

294
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,830
are rather the UK government's official
figure which is the only official figure

295
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,440
I've heard

296
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,500
is that one percent of the population is
transgender in some way

297
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,220
and yet people tell me all the time that
I'm the only or the first trans person

298
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,190
they've met

299
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,200
somebody's not telling the truth I and
they have a very good reasons they can

300
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,270
they they don't dare be

301
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,010
out I'm not real I was never I never
thought less of a real man

302
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,480
now many people don't consider me a real
woman I am not real

303
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,899
are I have become a thing a curiosity
something so weird it's perfectly

304
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:01,330
acceptable to ask me

305
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,340
are who I love how and when up which
bathroom I use how and when

306
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,889
are all sorts of things like that that
you would ask other people

307
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,899
there is sometimes a flinch factor

308
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:16,059
in being seen as beauty friends
acquaintances whatever I think somehow

309
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:16,629
the rice

310
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:20,679
she's trans people to realize she's
transfer you can think about me

311
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,980
this happens I have lost friends

312
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,409
virtually all the couple my family no
longer speak to me

313
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:30,730
arm a career I spent over 20

314
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,379
well over 25 years teaching it's very
frustrating for me to hear people

315
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,860
talking about the need for

316
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,559
educators who also know how to program
because in fact the odds me ever

317
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,080
appearing in front of high school and
middle school students again are

318
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,649
virtually nil

319
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:46,549
and if you think I'm overstating that
you just think about how you would pitch

320
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:50,470
that to your local neighborhood

321
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,649
okay I am more joy

322
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:57,879
I when your trans you're always the
punchline have an easy joke

323
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:00,970
if I never hear the punchline and she
used to be a dude

324
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,249
again in my life I will still have more
than a lifetime supply

325
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:09,039
are their issues with rates there is

326
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,129
a very heightened risk violence

327
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:15,259
and as a a white person up

328
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:18,999
I've what's a privilege still I have a
job I have money all of that

329
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:23,159
I am far less likely to suffer this then
a trans woman of color

330
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:26,860
but even so relatively speaking
everybody's percentage goes up

331
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,789
if you're a trans woman this is all the
price that I have to pay to be who I am

332
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:37,570
but honestly I wouldn't change this if I
could it took me a long time to get here

333
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,179
but I'm at the place where now if you
offered me the chance to go back

334
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:44,779
are long long time ago to central
Nebraska and fix things

335
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:50,029
I don't even know what that would mean I
wouldn't take it

336
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:53,399
and that's partly because I think that
as trans people we have something that

337
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:54,399
is very rare

338
00:19:54,399 --> 00:20:00,429
in very valuable we've actually seen
some of these things from both sides

339
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:04,070
high-impact what was surprising to me

340
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,539
transitioning to to to be perceived as a
woman

341
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:12,139
were all things that I thought I had
figured out that I thought I knew

342
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:15,379
I and in fact

343
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:18,789
it's different when they really apply to
you as opposed to just thinking about

344
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:22,330
so I met some people who I thought we
just amazingly bring it

345
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,249
that seem to have no recognition
whatsoever

346
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:29,369
that didn't feel like they were welcome

347
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:32,539
that didn't even always feel safe in
other words

348
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:35,690
I was in a different world

349
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:41,190
arm and you know someone these things
and stephen was alluded to when we were

350
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,489
people were talking at the pie ladies
lunch I now in technical

351
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:49,710
no contacts here think I've been many
others certainly at work

352
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,609
I'm the only woman in the room I have
now become invisible this one was a real

353
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:54,700
surprise to me

354
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,879
I was all worried about being harassed
me came to Python the first time

355
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:02,499
as a woman no I was invisible basically
almost every woman died

356
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:06,909
even maybe interacted with on Twitter
recognize me or interacted with me

357
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:11,609
and almost every guy including people I
had known for 10 years or more

358
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:16,249
looked right through me I honestly and
and and again it's sorry but this is

359
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:19,249
true I honestly had to step in front of
some of these people

360
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:22,769
and yell at them to get them to see me I
N and it's

361
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:26,330
it's not as though they didn't know I
had transitioned or anything like that

362
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,749
%uh so and and eventually done some
looking around this is actually fairly

363
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:30,679
common thing

364
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:34,899
are Men arcade have trained not to pay
attention to women in professional

365
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:35,619
settings

366
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:38,679
so this is it's just I I found it to be
true

367
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,419
I am now always judged by my appearance
as anywhere else female in the room

368
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:47,409
will be able to talk about a great lakes
I cannot assume personal security

369
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:48,090
anymore

370
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,159
this is something that i think is a guy
you don't even think about you go where

371
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:52,720
you want when you want

372
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,749
I can't do that anymore double standards
are now the norm

373
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,460
as a guy a used to be arm just a nice
guy

374
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,489
not just a nice guy as as a woman

375
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,210
shortly after a transition I got
feedback both that I was too nice

376
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,919
and I was an approachable at the same
him

377
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,220
I don't know how to do that so these are
all things that kind of

378
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,649
that have to do with being marginalized
and

379
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:22,659
so if you're not a if you're not
marginalized

380
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:27,009
you don't understand that you know the
things that you want for a conference

381
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:28,509
for space for anything

382
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:32,559
tend to be viewed by the group as extra
in your not always sure

383
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,330
if you're welcome arm if you object to
something

384
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,649
and these are all sorted from my
experience interacting particularly on

385
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:44,059
I with with people in the pipeline
community even I

386
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,639
if you object to something you're angry
and probably your bad attitude is

387
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,179
hurting your cause

388
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:52,239
I am and and being angry can be like

389
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:55,340
just sort of know I just said dishonor I
am

390
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,269
you can if you call somebody out these
are two words that I really hate

391
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:02,639
you can be bullying people with
political correctness are starting which

392
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:02,929
%uh

393
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:07,119
I've never seen anybody start a real
witch hunt

394
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,989
these ball strike me as people who are
privileged to don't want things to

395
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,379
change this is what I see when I see
those words

396
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:17,259
and no matter what kind blowback you get
you started

397
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:21,919
and we've seen this in the pike on world
many times we've seen on tech world

398
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,929
we get a big blow up this way probably
every six to nine months in the tech

399
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:26,639
world

400
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,730
this just happens so

401
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,299
those are all the things are going on in
them

402
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:36,489
business world I know this cuz I had to
go through when I i transition we talked

403
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:37,720
about this a great link

404
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,159
there's a business case for diversity
businesses now no

405
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,440
in the business that I work with I'm the
only out transgender person in

406
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,720
are North America a 16,000 employees

407
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,799
okay it's a very all 85-year-old
conservative company

408
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,279
Daisy have a party line that diverse
group called to solve problems better

409
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,230
and that we need every single talented
employees we can get we don't wanna lose

410
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,440
the people we have already we want the
biggest possible employees pool

411
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,970
all those things are the standard
business case

412
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,070
for diversity

413
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:16,100
so this should also then be true the
should be even more true

414
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,619
in the open source impact on communities
I and yeah I honestly I'd

415
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:24,869
I was not able to catch adidas keynote
but I gather that's exactly what he said

416
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:27,200
I want to listen to that part definitely

417
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,119
um if we're talking about being

418
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,639
open which we do all the time that
necessarily implies

419
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:39,989
I at you know the notion inclusion and
diversity

420
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:45,009
so here again i at the end and the Wii
is in question marks because these I am

421
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:47,330
not speaking for every March wise person
in the world

422
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,619
I am just trying to give you an idea of
some things that occurred to me what do

423
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,200
we want how can you shot us

424
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,710
up how can you keep us from being so
irritating arm

425
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,119
okay here your some things first wall
understand that everyone is different I

426
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,080
don't mean this in the sense of
diversity

427
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,659
we're going to get a certain
predetermined ratio of genders in colors

428
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:06,950
and things like that mean

429
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,129
everyone is different in a murine a
different weights

430
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:15,429
alright we have a whole like enormous
bank of different little settings all

431
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:16,539
that can be different

432
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:20,029
aren't you could have sexuality said
here you can generate issue here

433
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:23,100
reset here religion here all of these
things

434
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,909
and they are not connected the fact that
two people happen to have their

435
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,009
sexuality setting

436
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:32,399
in the or less the same place whatever
that might be says nothing about the

437
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:33,679
rest a bit

438
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,609
I think the more that we embrace this
fact the more than a lot of the other

439
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:39,820
issues go away

440
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,100
lipsky um listen to its

441
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,600
spots a social justice movements now
have kind of a little motto nothing

442
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,799
about us without us

443
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,139
but codes of conduct

444
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:55,859
up codes of conduct that actually say
something real

445
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:00,419
are very important codes of conduct it's
a trust us we're all nice guys

446
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:03,999
don't in fact those make me angry
because that missing the entire point

447
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:07,720
a code of conduct I outreach matters

448
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,739
I I need to thank I would never have
given the stalk

449
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:14,629
anywhere if somebody had asked me to do
it I certainly wouldn't be giving it

450
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:15,239
here

451
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:18,190
if Jessica and asked me to give a talk I
don't think this was the one she was

452
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,379
barking on but she's been very gracious
about it

453
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:24,210
arm outreach matters allies matter

454
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,299
this is important I have never witnessed
in decades being undercover as a sis

455
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:30,299
gender person

456
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,960
and being undercover as a male person I
have never witnessed

457
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,080
when when when it's just that group I
have never witnessed somebody standing

458
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,570
up

459
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,779
to say not that you really shouldn't do
that that's transphobic

460
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:45,289
or no you really shouldn't do that
that's sexist I'm not saying it's never

461
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:46,379
happened I'm saying

462
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:51,609
for decades I've never seen it we need
allies that will actually do that

463
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,909
safe spaces spaces where you can go one
way or another whether it's

464
00:26:54,909 --> 00:27:00,289
all trans R all women or whatever or if
it's some other strategy

465
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:03,789
ways to make yourself comfortable so
that you'll take part

466
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:08,559
are very very important so to conclude

467
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,669
if we're gonna throw around words like
open fair inclusion

468
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:16,869
inclusive things like that I would argue
those have to be true for everyone

469
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:23,869
and that's all I've got thank you

470
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:36,200
look

471
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,540
now I am freaked out thank you so much
hmm

472
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,820
we have time for what one or two
questions but wanted to you

473
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:52,110
yeah sure thank you so much for sharing
that experience as

474
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,670
arm one thing that I have noticed in the
community and

475
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,940
not everyone does their but on

476
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,170
people who are in a marginalized group
often feel very threatened to the point

477
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:03,970
where

478
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,060
if they genuinely are being a jerk to
someone and you say

479
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,200
hey stop that your being a jerk to them
just the way that you would say that to

480
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,890
any non marginalize person

481
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,910
they go your assaulting my identity

482
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,430
rather than going you're criticizing my
behavior

483
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:23,200
do you have any suggestions on how one
can give them that feedback

484
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,000
to maintain and non-hostile community
when that hostility

485
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,220
is coming from and marginalized group

486
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,980
have I don't I guess the thing that I
would like it

487
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,450
if I were doing that in that case and if
it really was

488
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,390
sorted that threatening a at the
situation is somebody that release

489
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,780
really clearly that I am

490
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,010
you know felt that way is that maybe
this

491
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,200
would be done sir Dave in a very low key
kinda privately first

492
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,400
I i hesitate to say oh well you know we
deserve special treatment or something

493
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,510
like that we've got somebody who's
scared already

494
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,920
then maybe keeping things very low-level
might be

495
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,230
a way to start but I I don't know it
depends you

496
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:10,470
thank you very much 11 high and you were
talking about the experiences

497
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,400
being invisible are feeling invisible
when you came to the conference

498
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,040
and I wonder am I if that

499
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,000
in some way for some people whom I did
been looking right through you

500
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,940
if it was at a flip side reaction to

501
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,520
not wantin to staring not knowing how to
relate to you like to do you think that

502
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:32,980
there is

503
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,040
that kind of misunderstanding going on
or

504
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,940
how how would you know I I considered
that but the vast majority of them

505
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,790
the really they looked certain right at
me and then read on

506
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,430
through me and any update it really was
almost surprising it wasn't one of these

507
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:50,970
third

508
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:55,460
it was just sort if and and that their
reactions have completely

509
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,510
surprise when I actually would say
something tended to confirm that

510
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:06,510
right thank mmm get big again the next
talk in this room is married
