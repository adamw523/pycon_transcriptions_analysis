1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:07,020
American accent Guido van Rossum yeah

2
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,910
you know one of the things that I love
about we know is that he is always

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,520
willing to share his pinion

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,939
and so I was thinking about what

5
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:28,980
it will I was thinking that the first
question that I

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,180
that the time I ask you just sort of
Kiko vertically as whether even have

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,420
Python 2.8

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,949
ob and sell

9
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:40,510
we know is truly

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,360
he is the his a not only been in it
never did care for life

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,550
but he is part he is the guiding force

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,879
that helps keep us all in line least

13
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,309
it least programming language wise so
without further ado

14
00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:02,309
Guido van Rossum the

15
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,290
thank you fan well van too hard act to
follow so I'm not even going to try

16
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,140
I I have a question for the organization

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,670
is it possible to have microphones out
there so some people can

18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,880
ask questions or am I too late with that
request

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,720
there are microphones okay on an island
go to my father slide

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,830
so to be honest

21
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,560
I always stress out for a keynote

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,690
and is here and was worse

23
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,710
and I had total complete mental block

24
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,979
because the thing i really wanna do if

25
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,890
give you another super technical excited
talk about to let

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,429
a sin que el cap 250 3156 buck

27
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:59,229
there were like three or four talks in
the regular program already dead

28
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,960
explained it better than I could

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,060
I did that talked last year I did it
again

30
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,759
at the San Francisco buy from me
defended by did it again at the Bay Area

31
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,079
pie from the interest group

32
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:13,950
I really don't want to certif repeat
myself in that way

33
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,590
so I was really thinking

34
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,730
oh my god what can I do maybe maybe I
should just read from fan mail

35
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,790
because I get a lot of fan mail

36
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,420
and if if you're if you've got a
certified certain type of brain

37
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,739
its all very funny but

38
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,170
actually then I thought about it and I
thought moment probably some of the

39
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,430
people who wrote me that fan mail

40
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,709
are India's audience and I don't want to
embarrass you

41
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,480
I don't want to embarrass myself and
maybe it's not actually that funny

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,730
so I collected I asked on Twitter what
should I talk about

43
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,910
I said have racked my brain every time I
had sorta

44
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,519
a brainwave all I should talk about that
I just added to a list and then finally

45
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,620
a lacked last night I collected all
lists I had

46
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,450
women text file I thought oh I'm going
to become randomly

47
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,230
so the first thing I'm going to do is
actually write the code that will

48
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,560
randomly pick

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,239
something from the less now they'll give
me some time to grieve

50
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,849
also at I would love to take questions
and as you can see

51
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:36,310
I today I'm making a choice to only take
questions from women in the audience

52
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,040
because throughout the conference I've
been

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,709
attacked by people with questions and
they were almost all man so I think the

54
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,459
women have Sardar there a lil behind and
they can catch up here

55
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,280
Island see how can I find my

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,209
you I bingo

57
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:04,209
okay let's see will win either random
number generator I think

58
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,060
so year

59
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,580
near display how do that that is very
sad

60
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:21,580
%uh PowerPoint too clever one sec

61
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,860
now handling it

62
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,680
you see that yeah so

63
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,370
a see what what was the rest of the plan
and let's define a function

64
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,320
analysts big question

65
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,630
now

66
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:01,500
like see for 11 global variable okay we
have a list of questions

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,420
but is not yet initialized

68
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,760
actually I can K you know I wanna I
wanted

69
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,540
uninitialized initially and

70
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,590
you can you get you cancer to get a peek
in

71
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,990
into my brain by hearing me talk about
what im

72
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,630
what im doing well programming so we
have a list of questions and we do

73
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,420
something like

74
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,590
if list of questions is

75
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,070
Mt we're gonna have to initialize it

76
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,630
so what show we initialize it to

77
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,780
questions is open and some file

78
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,750
so what was that

79
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:51,250
II

80
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:58,250
classy I'm so glad we at least we have
static type analysis here

81
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:04,760
live static type analysis we should we
should

82
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,880
all have that in in our software and
opinionated

83
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,300
to Co programmer who

84
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:18,260
tells you when you're screwing up

85
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,760
the

86
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,490
K E and we're going to use return around

87
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:30,490
choice

88
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:39,099
left chill chill just tried this

89
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:47,629
let's try to slow slow see if I can
remember how to run it

90
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:50,869
source must be saved sure

91
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:57,869
yeah

92
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,350
I know several have you already saw this
coming so

93
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,690
I'm

94
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,610
on this issue really weird

95
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,970
clearly in Heidelberg I can't I can't
get my cock cursor care where I want

96
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:30,970
I so this is this is certif

97
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,169
this is a taste of what students trying
to learn Python

98
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:39,300
are going through in real life sometimes

99
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,120
and somehow I managed to solve my
problem

100
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,410
yes and

101
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,940
CA and run geekdom

102
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,940
it I think they're worth

103
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,090
airline that just said geekdom in my
list the question so let me see what I

104
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,620
can

105
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,889
add live about geekdom I

106
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,970
I'm a terrible geek myself I mean

107
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,580
cool earth would you write such a stupid
program in front of 2,000 people

108
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,700
and think they can get away with it then
stabbed is like as sign up absolute

109
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,720
total

110
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,110
lack of social skills last last night I
discovered one ive one ive mining

111
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,520
Eagles charms is I do not know how to
extract myself from a conversation

112
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,640
many of you have profited from that many

113
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,450
others accuse have wondered when

114
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,340
I was ever done Kayla different let's
let's pick a different question

115
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:47,340
and again probably just type it here
oppose the idea of exception

116
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,710
expression that sounds like a half-assed

117
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,490
question but I think what it comes from
and it's probably one of those things I

118
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,140
copied and pasted from Twitter

119
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,490
there's being a very elaborate pap

120
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,430
that propose that we

121
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,860
at a new type of expression to Python
against its gonna have to be added to by

122
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,000
2035

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,780
if we're going to do it and it would
like

124
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,020
let them actually hey I have I can't I P
I can

125
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,710
can show what it was supposed to look
like something like axe

126
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,250
is the the of by

127
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,620
days for X there the

128
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,820
slit settlers a.m. accepted the key
error

129
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,170
and if it was a key error will say

130
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,480
its none out his lead is not currently
valid syntax 0

131
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,320
but that's what it would look like

132
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,910
and their hall that the

133
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,120
the PAP goes on at Lang in all the
incredibly

134
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,580
good use cases where currently you have
to write a four-line try except flock to

135
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,810
do some very simple

136
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,180
seeing and we have a whole bunch of
methods in the standard library on

137
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,060
various functions objects

138
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,760
that are only dare

139
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,740
according to the author of this pap
offers to

140
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,570
to certify deal with the fact that you
you can't

141
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,780
caption exception certificates Eisley

142
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,100
and I'm still I'm still

143
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,620
against this idea I think its on

144
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,310
ugly syntactic wards to at this and the
call on in the syntax drives me nuts but

145
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:37,680
any

146
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,790
other sin tax proposal that has has been
sir def

147
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,580
considered for the PAP looks even not
clear to me

148
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,910
and I really don't think that there is a
big problem

149
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,480
to beast that that's being solved here
the problem is

150
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,080
that sometimes people 12 food everything
in one line

151
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,310
and I think that's just that certain

152
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,430
burge you should try to resist and just
be

153
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,970
take a pause take a breath its

154
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,970
okee to to spend a few extra words were
not were not pearl

155
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:19,809
I

156
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:23,459
enough on that topic let's pick another
question DVD

157
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:28,540
who here even knows what KVS oh that's
awesome

158
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,720
who has ever used TV

159
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,610
well soak EV is more popular than I
thought

160
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,089
I don't know if any of the key people
developers are here

161
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:43,759
TV is Inc the Redis

162
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,110
great tool that you can use to write hi
phone code

163
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,279
on your mobile devices and

164
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,660
it has back and is actually it has
certif implementations are back and what

165
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,189
you can

166
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:58,920
wanna call them that run on my OS or on
iPad

167
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,550
on iPhone but also on Android then you
can also run your program

168
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,999
and in the browser on the desktop

169
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:10,079
and I'm I may be mentioning some

170
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,730
use cases that aren't actually yet
implemented the TV certif

171
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,800
lets you write beautiful

172
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,149
user interface applications that will
run on a variety of platforms including

173
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,870
mobile devices

174
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,769
unfortunately when I talk to the people

175
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:32,309
at home at work at Dropbox who are
developing

176
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:38,189
aP's former for mobile devices Dropbox
just launched a few new apt for mobile

177
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:39,339
devices this week

178
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:44,509
day said well we would love to be able
to use that but it's not fast enough

179
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:48,689
and I think the key people

180
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:52,189
deserve incredible kudos for

181
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:58,249
starting it but they need help they need
a need more technical expertise

182
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:04,179
for all those different phone platforms
and for Python to help to make it faster

183
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:04,889
to help

184
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,899
maybe build a community around TV that
is

185
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:13,949
is larger so that keep you can actually
be successful because pipe from

186
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:20,360
doesn't have a story for mobile devices
and if TV is the only story for mobile

187
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,179
devices we have we need to

188
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:25,360
worked a lot on that story so if you
have

189
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,829
into rest in hacking on something
incredibly cool

190
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:34,720
that will benefit everybody who is go
who was eventually going to

191
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,179
be using mobile devices and mobile
devices

192
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:42,339
will get better and lots of things will
will sort of

193
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,339
open up once you support mobile devices

194
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,519
we gotta get Python in the phones and
waiting for

195
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,850
boon to mobile or Mozilla mobile OS

196
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,990
I don't think that that's it that's been

197
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,290
the sort of the successful strategy for
actually getting pie from on the phones

198
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,129
enough about that question

199
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:08,999
worse the next one how awesome despite

200
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:14,549
3.4 yet have you checked it out yet it
is awesome

201
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:21,549
it is the best pipe from ever

202
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,570
and its incredibly accessible it is

203
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:33,360
also easier than effort to port code
from by 2022 Piper flee or to write

204
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,560
coded works both in by phone to and pie
from the

205
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,680
3.4 is

206
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,580
the biggest step I would say

207
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,700
towards making everyone happy

208
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,910
and police go used by complete at fort
even if your main project is still

209
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,350
written in Python to

210
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,650
start getting yourself used to biking

211
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,310
3 download fifa leader for installers as
the

212
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,890
ultimate Python interpreter arm every
system you have

213
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,230
play around with it the number I folks

214
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,950
are very close to switching to buy
completely already

215
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,250
of your web developer using flask for
Django

216
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,080
well there are some theoretical
Portsmouth

217
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,470
it's still hard but give it a try and if
you find something that doesn't work

218
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,800
with by completely wrapped

219
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,890
help someone make it work

220
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,170
as as fam said we are this community and
we can

221
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,280
we can make it happen yes we can we can
all work on being a community and its us

222
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,170
an arson

223
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,660
community community but there's lot of
software that needs to be

224
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,650
improved and fixed and and and sometimes
thrown away

225
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,690
and that's that's what this community is
for so

226
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,460
please help us anyone have a question
yet

227
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:01,090
you're not a woman

228
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:08,090
p.m. can you get your girlfriend to ask
that question

229
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,900
all sorts of yes

230
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:18,900
other side I'm curious what you think
the worst part

231
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,220
contributing see python is today you
mean the

232
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,750
though the worst part of the experience
of of trying to contribute

233
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,490
whatever is the biggest headache 30

234
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,790
perform well for me personally there
aren't very many headaches

235
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,130
what's the Serta but what I worry about
most

236
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,580
is that it is so incredibly difficult

237
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,580
to get started and it

238
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,490
it used to be that that So Def when I
first wrote

239
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:58,610
see pipe bomb I mean it was the most
complex code I had ever written but I

240
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,740
try to write it as sort of a
straightforward and simple and clear as

241
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,520
possible

242
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,240
and four years people said wow you got
it you gotta read the C code for Python

243
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,290
because it's so clear you can actually
understand how language works

244
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,380
but then generations of people have

245
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,290
added contributions and we added unique
code in

246
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,080
various slow things were improve so they
were faster and there's a

247
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,680
custom memory allocator and the code is
actually not straightforward at

248
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,230
all anymore and so it's very easy to

249
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,880
certif think oh here's

250
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,320
fearsome here's a little bug in Python I
bet I can fix that

251
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,240
let's look it up in the source code and
be completely overwhelmed

252
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,240
and sir if you find well I also talked
to a lot of people who say well

253
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,340
and piping program I don't knowingly see
so it sort of

254
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,100
which which is shocking for me because
when I wrote

255
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,100
when I started hi farm I mean every

256
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,600
everybody was a C programmer and then
maybe they would also learn some other

257
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,360
languages like Perl Python

258
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:14,330
so what certif I do know exactly what we
can do to get people

259
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,040
into contributing more but I agree there
is

260
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,900
dairies a difficulty in getting started
and

261
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,690
and here I'm just talking about the
technical difficulty understanding the

262
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,550
code in finding out how it's organized
and

263
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,810
finding where did being that

264
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,630
jury view you see something wrong
happening

265
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,770
figuring out where in the C code that

266
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,560
that wrong decision is being made is far
from from simple

267
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,220
you may have to run a debugger you may
have to

268
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,240
grab all the source for magic strings on

269
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,690
if often certif in

270
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,300
indirect phenomena Rotterdam there's
just the line of code it does the wrong

271
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,980
thing

272
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:06,740
so unfortunately that puts the bar for
successful contributions very high and

273
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,810
this is even before we get to the point
of well

274
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,510
if you have fixed something can
successfully

275
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,570
now you have to come convince accord
report developer

276
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,780
to give your patch the light of day

277
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,120
look at your bug report looked at your
patch

278
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,550
give you feedback help you sort of make
it also work on all the other platforms

279
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,560
we care about

280
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,840
so I would I would love if we could

281
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,090
certain if this move now that process
and

282
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,400
it used to be that I was the one who did

283
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,170
all that and intuitive I would sometimes
take shortcuts now they're

284
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,860
there are too many contributions and too
many open bugs and too many

285
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,010
lingering patches for me to be very
successful in

286
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,800
taken care of all that even though I I
want to

287
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,760
bud everyone else who is assertive
really knowledgeable and I'll

288
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,480
basically all the people who can review
your patch

289
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,030
are already very busy and so the
question is how do we can grow

290
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,550
that several people how do we get more
people

291
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,540
into the core certif and it's a high bar
to pass you have to

292
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,300
sorta first win the trust of the
existing core developers because

293
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,940
week we also don't want a bunch of
newbies

294
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:37,180
certified changing pipe bomb and add new
features that

295
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,990
don't actually work or will will
distract

296
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,930
a other users more break on certain
platform so there is

297
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,930
there is a real certify reason for for
having

298
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,170
thorough technical review for all
contributions but at the same time

299
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:58,820
duck that review process and the process
of getting new people involved has

300
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,870
become very

301
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,910
heavyweight and cumbersome to that that
is

302
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,980
as is something done does worry me and
thanks for for asking

303
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:13,980
thank you

304
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,090
so discussions about up high country for

305
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:22,110
when I had teach a class arm we often
have this conversation and what version

306
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,450
up I found two years

307
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,720
and we often a

308
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,610
do not use and 34 without 27

309
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,240
re I go through the process of
explaining at the hard thing for new

310
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,510
people to understand why we would be
using

311
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,100
why you would want to use 27 over 34
when in every other aspect of our lives

312
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,610
are always wanna be on the newest and
greatest and best

313
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,730
so my question for you is am

314
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,530
with small incremental changes that are
happening in the community as people

315
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,679
upgrade libraries

316
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,830
arm when you see the tipping point
happening

317
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,559
where there's a large majority side have

318
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:04,570
Mitt taking a lot of action to move over
234 cuz I i mean

319
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,799
maybe I'm wrong but I personally feel
like it hasn't gained as much momentum

320
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,299
as as I would help

321
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:14,770
that's a very valid concern

322
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:19,280
a I am personally

323
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,030
very optimistic that this will sort
itself

324
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,130
out now how exactly will it will it sort
itself out

325
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,400
my mice are def what

326
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,600
what I see I talk to people in different
sup communities

327
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,919
I talk to educators I talk to scientists
I talked to web developers I talk to

328
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,630
says Matt administrators

329
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,870
and everybody

330
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,700
actually assertive has a different view

331
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,610
there are people who say well when I
teach a class

332
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,190
I don't use any third party libraries

333
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,179
and I just use the turtle module that in
the standard library

334
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,490
and I'm so happy with Python 3 because
like

335
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,730
these can things that used to always
dread my students over in class when I

336
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,690
was using buy from two to teach have

337
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,840
all gone away you can thank you for
listening to our complains about cloud

338
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,809
bite into

339
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:18,980
and changing the input function and this
and that

340
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,230
and so Darius a group of people who are

341
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,240
really have the game there other people
who

342
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,900
right large certif new code

343
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,160
and dayy d like to do everything
themselves

344
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,700
and they also say oh wow let I can use
the a sync i/o library in Python 3.3 or

345
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,850
3.4

346
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,340
I'm so excited I'm going to write my
whole new framework based on Python 3

347
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,860
using a single i/o I'm super excited
about this

348
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,950
then there are two people who have
sixteen million lines of code

349
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:02,760
written by 3,000 certif mediocre skilled
programmers

350
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,720
and ended its all Python 2.7 button

351
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,260
have a bit is probably actually was
written in the days of item 2.3

352
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,040
only just by the grace of God skill is
compatible with 2.7

353
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,770
or every once in a while there the
someone fixes it when it

354
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,950
when it breaks but not before the break

355
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,380
and those people have no

356
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:33,100
did Eric they're just completely
overwhelmed by how

357
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,070
on earth are we going to get this much
code in

358
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,450
it written in a dynamic language where
there are no type declarations the

359
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,630
compiler is

360
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,840
okay with almost anything you type how
are we going to get this code ported

361
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,010
over to pipe from

362
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,559
3 and and certif still be assured that
the output

363
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:57,100
is correct because thats really what we
care about

364
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,300
and and so I think they're there is

365
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,480
any credible spectrum

366
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,240
it turns out from talking to various
people in the numerical or scientific by

367
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,210
from world

368
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,409
but does guys are actually had over the
web developers

369
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:18,530
the number by a world has more
successfully not only ported

370
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:24,080
the software but is in the process of
porting the community to Python 3

371
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,740
they asked for a matrix multiply
operator in Python 3

372
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,130
they're getting it in 3.5 which is still
a year and a half down the road

373
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,340
but they're already excited about it and

374
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:41,570
and that by itself is giving them a lot
of motivation to serve be ready when

375
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,450
that matrix multiply operator

376
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,929
arrives in the language at

377
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:51,530
my colleagues at Dropbox are not so
excited about porting to buy for free

378
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,190
because they've got

379
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,440
a huge live code base and and there are
like

380
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,159
dozens of developers who add more to it
every day

381
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,250
many of those developers have sort of
tunnel vision their focus on one

382
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,840
particular feature

383
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,840
or one particular abstraction and
there's no one who has a good overview

384
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,419
over serb what what would happen if we
try to run this

385
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:21,010
in the pipe roughly and even with
smaller code base is that we have a drop

386
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,840
box that are somewhat separate from that

387
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,000
a we've we found out

388
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,800
if you if you certify use every hack in
the book

389
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,590
dead and then many of those hacks are
going to do not work

390
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,419
with the next version of pipe Anna

391
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,030
what are we going to do about it
patience

392
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:50,440
let certif don't

393
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,240
don't worry you don't bang your head
against the wall because you're behind

394
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,559
curve

395
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,780
there are plenty of people who are
skilled happily running Windows XP on

396
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,620
their computers to

397
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,179
maybe mate maybe not so happily after
Microsoft the

398
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:10,470
stop the support but never lasts

399
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,669
lead they're still running XP

400
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:19,340
but it will be many many years before
buy from 27 is sort of

401
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,460
abandoned by the pie from poor
developers

402
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,500
I admit that when we first planned title
3

403
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,750
and the transition we thought that five
years was a really long time because for

404
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,559
me personally i

405
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,270
I'm bad at predicting in the future and
I'm really bad at looking

406
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,820
say five years or more when people ask
me what

407
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,820
gonna happen in 10 years I just throw my
hands up in the air

408
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,530
so we lead Sep what we thought was a
conservative

409
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:55,620
trajectory for how long we would support
by from 27

410
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,120
there is a PAP that declares the end of
life or buy from 27 something like May

411
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,510
2015 which is actually

412
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:07,350
in a little over a year we just had a
long discussion about that topic

413
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,390
at the language said summit earlier this
week

414
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:15,050
and we're going to update that perhaps
and we're going to make it clear that

415
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:19,590
well was still want everyone to think
about moving and we're going to

416
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,809
certif helped people port and I hope
many of you

417
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:28,159
went to for example Tracy vers talk
about porting to buy perfectly and a

418
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,070
specific strategy of

419
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:35,270
writing single source code that can
execute correctly both on the vital to

420
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:40,159
and buy from 384 for high enough
versions of iPhone to

421
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,480
the and we're going to pour more
resources

422
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,380
in helping people make certain if that
porting process successful

423
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:55,909
but the help is not going to come in the
form of compromise versions of Python

424
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,360
to help is going to come in the form of
tools

425
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,790
less specific port help importing

426
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,520
stragglers in the that certain if the
dependency ecosystem like if there's a

427
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,470
particular module it still hasn't been

428
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,460
4 to Dubai from three and it is holding
people back

429
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,890
and the PSF or other organizations that
have have some

430
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,340
interested in this will be able to help

431
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,540
and so what

432
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,690
what you can do yourself is a don't
panic

433
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,710
Bebo opportunistic certif

434
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,309
you probably have a whole bunch of
different pipe from projects

435
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,440
see if there's one review projects where
you can use by completely answered have

436
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,570
become comfortable with print as a
function and learn to use all the cool

437
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,899
new

438
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:53,520
as a unico support and that bites for
his is taxed

439
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,000
and so five years from now I'll be
standing here again and I'll I'll be

440
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,550
looking back and I think we'll be in a
much

441
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,970
much better situation and fifteen years
from now we'll all

442
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,810
sort of look back and laugh about when
we were also worried about

443
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:17,310
the by from two to three transition and
I never wanna do another transition

444
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:22,100
in the same way fortunately software
changes so fast and

445
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,470
need to have better tools become
available that what Everton next

446
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,330
step is that we're going to have to take
beyond 3

447
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,679
and will be able to plan taking that
step in a very different way and we

448
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,220
won't

449
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,300
have have to have discussions like that

450
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:46,300
biz you

451
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,190
paid what's up we don't I am a byproduct

452
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,880
graduate student and I love iPhone
especially a scientific Python stack

453
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,809
however I do not love installing it and

454
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:04,420
I was wondering and it kinda makes it
very easy UN actually meant just

455
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,090
mentioned that there's plans to
introduce meters implication

456
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,270
in the future are there any other plans
to integrate I done with other blaster

457
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:16,250
and kill libraries in the future to make
to integrate the scientific libraries

458
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:22,450
with arm for Python I'm not really the
right person to

459
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,690
to answered after and

460
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,220
my understanding is that there are
several companies

461
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,720
in the scientific numeric by from the
world who are competing in the

462
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,270
tournament

463
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,350
building the best magar superjumbo

464
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,290
sumo installers the include as much

465
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,910
third-party numerical software

466
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,490
as as they can manage their are

467
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,570
installers both from and fart and from

468
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,169
Anna continuum

469
00:31:56,169 --> 00:32:02,070
that that claim to solve your problem I
don't and and I'm not and scientist in

470
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,370
that sense myself

471
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:08,950
I have never had the opportunity to try
it but I hear from a lot of other people

472
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,140
dad their actually doing very well

473
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,100
with nose installers and maybe some of
it

474
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,730
is well at the latest version of the
installer will be even better

475
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,799
but I think you have great

476
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,429
deal of reason for optimism there thank
you

477
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:35,429
you're welcome on

478
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:42,570
I went to Julie pagano's excellent talk
yesterday on imposter syndrome and one

479
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,390
of the things she spoke about was taking
your heroes

480
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,700
ahh pedestals and making them seem like
a

481
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,860
regular human beings again so the
question that I wanted to ask you

482
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,800
is are there times in either Python or
other software projects are other things

483
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,880
you work on that you feel intimidated or

484
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,740
like you don't have the skills that you
need or any of the other things that

485
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,910
especially people just getting started

486
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,929
feel when they try to contribute back to
the community

487
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:14,010
I have a lot of that

488
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:18,390
all the time I can be incredibly
insecure

489
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,460
one news item that that Sir def

490
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,120
touts the virtues of Perl 6 can

491
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,120
can game make me sleep mad

492
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:39,139
someone asked me this morning while I
was walking to the hotel

493
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:42,539
about they have like Edward

494
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:47,249
they have one obnoxious Java programmer
and the Java programmers always showing

495
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:51,169
of the superior tools in the Java world
like he can attach

496
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:57,369
a debugger to a running process and
extracted stack traces in n/a me gently

497
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,239
start

498
00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:03,330
certif hyperventilating and thinking oh
my gosh

499
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:07,789
why don't we have that and then I
realized old well yeah

500
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:11,040
lived wing where and pie chart room and
then

501
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,300
komodo probably all do that too because

502
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,830
is just a matter of a little bit of
technology we don't have an interest in

503
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,250
our library but really

504
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,240
we hardly have a debugger in the
standard library I'm probably the only

505
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,190
person

506
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,990
who who is still the bugs using just BB

507
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:31,560
as it is in the standard library so

508
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,820
if you want me off up my panda style

509
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,750
I'll happily come off

510
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:44,750
thank you you outcome

511
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,480
and that's all the time we have thank
you so much

512
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,490
you're welcome
