00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:18,500
doc is

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,950
at to infinity and

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,760
it did in by 10 to infinity and beyond I

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,240

few lines

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,530

I work as a community Gardiner in a

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,620
I should just thank them once because
the response on my travel and staying

and I shirt and bike on also portrayed
sponsoring my

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,000
bike on picket to finance the late and

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
maybe against start the real talk no so

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,259
the stock is actually about hearing

17
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:12,100
all our experiences and

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,340
teams which worked and what didn't work
far-out online summer training

19
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,580
we started this training

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,800
back in 2000 8 its

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,520
on lane its are it runs on IRC

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,220
its runs for anyone who has the

23
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,770
comparatively new Linux distribution on

24
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,170
open mind to learn stuff and

25
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,020
basically whoever wants to become a
contributor so

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,479
if you see that name BDP Lugt

27
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,600
thats you can guess elude use Linux
users group

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,869
and DB is the place where I'm from dude
up will

29
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,660
the nearest down from my village and
wind its mint I started that lot back in

30
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,590
2004

31
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,660
and during that time there was almost no
one

32
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,619
to pay less what exactly to do with this
thing called NX

33
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:09,310
other than clicking randomly and so

34
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,280
the goal of our whole lug was to learn
yourself

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,610
and peach others in Bengali Lake

36
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,520
chic or even Chicago me that the
transmission so

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,349
that's how we started doing or lug and
going ahead

38
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,970
but denby phone that there are many
enduring colleges

39
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,989
in that local 80 where we have so many
during college students

40
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:36,689
we're going to random companies to do
their summer training

41
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:40,120
where basically dead just being forty
months

42
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,720
summer amount of money learning nothing

43
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,120
at the end up the team is just they're
just getting a certificate

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,549
and they're trying to use that
certificate to get a better job

45
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,439
during college interviews in the final
year but

46
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,969
on most do you know knowledge Syrian the
so

47
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,110
destroy any started to actually have a
replacement for those kind of

48
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,060
I should say nonsense trainings where
people can only go only to beat seem

49
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,530
library management system yet after yet
and because

50
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,540
we already started doing a lot of free
software walk

51
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,569
as a contributor in different parts and
different projects

52
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:20,780
we talk that weekend actually feared the
whole King

53
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,780
as a summer training program so

54
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,569
from the very first year our goal was
always to

55
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:35,689
guarded the local people forced and then
the in a global event

56
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:39,260
so the initial idea was to go for of
lame campaign

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,640
as much as possible we started we
talking with the students who

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,900
we knew personally and then getting de
France contacts from their lake

59
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,629
in the same area audino other colleges
to ok India and

60
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,859
when I said quote India we started
getting into the part of mailing list

61
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:59,159
so that we announce it or mailing list
and

62
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,069
then it studied slowly started becoming
global effort

63
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,599
at the beginning it was only me

64
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,370
but I'll I'm going to name another
person here said the gunmen

65
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,370
he's not here but he is very well known
feder for us develop and mentor from

66
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:16,930
India

67
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,280
so he also teamed up with me to help out
the students

68
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,160
and we set up de ni si el parque Odom
thinks

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,540
to be done meet at any minimum req and

70
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,639
10 things we week think that we can get
out of this whole program

71
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,120
how things will go I and from there

72
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,150
Lake up him and he has a lot of people
are these tutorials online in this site

73
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,690
which you can just fine his name Google
you find those things

74
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,060
and then came the next tip because

75
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,420
on during those days I never heard the
word MOOC

76
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,440
as such and I know when you comin I only
know what the sites where we can go in

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,250
see some videos online videos to learn
about something

78
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,250
but which brings into this problem that

79
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,600
why we chose IRC as I what dude our
technology

80
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,780
we never had good band week when I spew
don't have

81
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,330
good banquet I'm right now the fastest
internet connection of my life

82
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,140
4mbps that is Lake and being a hundred
dollars for it

83
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,160
but I know most of the students in India
they don't have access to any

84
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,740
such internet now if they're lucky

85
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,890
daily Gate maybe 256 kbps if they are

86
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,970
in a big city there we get it read it is
this

87
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,810
of course but I S E was something which

88
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,950
was part of free software community I
thing from the very beginning

89
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,070
it walks it just works it's very less

90
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,270
man do it we can actually record the
stock because it's text

91
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,890
and weekend just keep the fights for the
later use

92
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,260
and I hope even in the time on nuclear
blasts and any other kind of catastrophe

93
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,990
IRC will be still there so that we can
contact with each other somehow

94
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,130
so regard okay we cry with IRC

95
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,010
and we did that offline and online
campaign in 2008

96
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,980
so first year we started out on

97
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,390
in students in doug has did you believe
buchanan

98
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,810
by the withdrawal we are calling it a
summer training we actually start on

99
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,670
most in the rainy season in India

100
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,800
Lake end of big government middle of
June

101
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,190
that start start timing so

102
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,050
out of 10 student I think I am the
training ran for three months

103
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,820
so a little bit more on the training is
that this is a addict

104
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,440
talk I mean dick on princess and I
should say between pic trainers and

105
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,780
students

106
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,820
so trainers will start talking in the
IRC channel and it will go on

107
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,770
deal many are some things like six hours
and d 2 a.m. in the night

108
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,530
for the student reduce a sense almost
every day night

109
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,060
other than weekends for first two months
and then

110
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,720
one month on are one and half month an
art project works

111
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,850
where we try to pose the same people
into afternoon

112
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,820
basis so out up in students regardless I
don't feel for students who stayed with

113
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,800
us

114
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,860
later they went in to defend other
projects

115
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,720
and that was the first year so we
started doing this year after year

116
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,670
2014 will be 78 for us

117
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,150
to last year

118
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,400
we started with AP students from

119
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,470
very different backgrounds when I
started these

120
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,410
the coolest injuring students but

121
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,410
I can give you an idea like what kind of
people we got our

122
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,860
not only from India from the side of the
world Lake North America

123
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,490
on after see it off Afghanistan Sri
Lanka

124
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,910
Obama this and

125
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,990
people came people talk with us many
people stayed

126
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,310
Lake out of eighty students you're
almost forty plus de ti that

127
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,050
three months training course they came
online almost every day

128
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,250
on time and gap between I mean

129
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,090
the Cape doing the stuff which was a
good

130
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,430
salt other than in years we had a me

back an we had friends got it

142
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,360
we started this program based on our
friends we

143
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,010
try to talk with to them we try to talk
to their friends and get students into

144
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,440
this project

145
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,450
and we never part I would award which
I'm hearing

146
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,480
in the last few years a lot of time the
word is

147
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
every 30 I we never acted the part about
that

148
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,310
white from the very beginning we had

149
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,770
about 50 percent all men participation

150
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,560
save money last year out of eighty-plus
students we had almost 42 or 43

151
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,660
woman participating in this program we
never had a problem

152
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,930
where it was Lake pic too many boys
auditors Lake

153
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,060
are too many men centric program or
anything or did

154
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,320
it was all is almost in the same 11

155
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,820
at from the very beginning and we also
makes you know that

156
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,000
the message board it goes out in a
proper way

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,400
due to different colleges so after just
after the first year

158
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,040
when we got few people who are doing
good both

159
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,790
men and a woman we actually tried to put
them up

160
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,070
in the local community as local
superheroes

161
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,480
so they went to their colleges to their
friends and he had their own knowledge

162
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,310
and their life story that how they
started from the UN

163
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,120
they become something and which keep
bringing in more and more students

164
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,460
from bolt men and a woman like that

165
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,560
diverse city park

166
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,310
few times we thought they come and
because its online sessions

167
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,430
you know people speak many random things

168
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,580
sometimes the doctrine as and few of us
who do take lessons we become kinda ET

169
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,640
and be use lot of sarcasm maybe

170
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,660
but it go so well in both cases there is
no Lake

171
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:58,660
if you are a student you are just a
student

172
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,950
one more thing which worked really well
West

173
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,850
staying in touch so we are not a kind a
program where he just runs for three

174
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,940
months and it's over

175
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,710
instead those students become our
friends this day online

176
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,930
in the same place again and again year
after year

177
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,770
we mix week trip we try to guide
imploded college-level

178
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,450
and even in Dec 11 wind lake which
companies to join wear to work on

179
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:30,700
Lake what kinda project we can walk in
future

180
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,020
the differences actually beauty that

181
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,940
when when is someone new is coming in
they might take that

182
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,070
old XD it's a huge community I just want
to go and learn something

183
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,990
we want to break that part aren't we
want to make sure that they learnt that

184
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,720
dr. the community

185
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,000
the out part of this we if we have to
grow we have to grow old together

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,470
and this message

187
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,770
on list is if we make sure that people
are coming back

188
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,380
people are staying in touch and repeat
the same exercise

189
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,810
yet after year

190
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,020
a little bit on the course outline what
we teach

191
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,920
starting from communication bike lanes
Mill English guidelines for Desire C you

192
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,890
are mailing list how you should talk

193
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,960
whack went to talk from the air to
basics of Linux distributions dominoes

194
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,180
demands you have to learn source code
management system

195
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,520
a lot ups trimming dine goes into
documentation

196
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,830
why documentation is necessary making
sure everything

197
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,990
everyone loans about documents and fast

198
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,400
even before the start writing any code
and we try to push it too hard to that

199
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,240
it becomes the head

200
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,770
natural habit to write good
documentation and

201
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,290
we're getting kinda good result out
there

202
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,710
and the final part of the training is
actually taking those individual

203
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,290
students and making them a contributor
to some

204
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,330
upstream project it can be anything

205
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:05,589
i coming to the project a little bit
later

206
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:09,650
so whatever happened in the last few
years seven years

207
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,940
past six years the log said their in
that you are if you go you'll find that

208
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,589
last

209
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:18,300
this unlocks this thing helps too

210
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,480
to revisit though whatever we did before
you find many fancy funny things

211
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,589
on the consistence kinda questions
people ask

212
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:33,589
so you may want to just go and visited
later on

213
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,960
and in any kind of citizens we

214
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,010
always said that you should start from
the scratch

215
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,440
do not as the only that your students
are the people who are here

216
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,400
Dino this thing are detecting in
technology

217
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,900
they may be are coming from a complete
different word nothing to do with

218
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,770
technology

219
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,990
they just want to learn it so

220
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,120
the clock to progress based on that
speed up the snow is student

221
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,540
not on the people who can just learn
everything every day

222
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,050
so we try to piece that class based on
that

223
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,380
this brings in some a funny story is
Lake lessons learned even seen one way

224
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,460
late so during the command line tools
and training sparked

225
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,510
we try to teach people how to do the
basic

226
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,330
level up building c:\program celebrities
and what is believed to be an issue what

227
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,370
is make

228
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,370
on the basic things

229
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,850
and no one under says and we can really
say

230
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,750
install Fedora by default up but if you
are coming with Anna the distribution

231
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,040
today be another 12

232
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,120
will still help you we tell you what is
the exact command to use to

233
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,640
get things done so defile answer for

234
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,180
installing all our disaffected was the
only study City

235
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,790
everyone said it worked it worked yet
what and suddenly one student came up is

236
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,210
Lake

237
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,920
it's not working it's not working for
almost half an hour

238
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,200
make three or four of us were trying to
help him out

239
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,220
and after all the commands we actually
knew to figure out what's wrong with the

240
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,529
yom in that box

241
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:13,950
somebody actually of steam or by the way
which distribution you are in

242
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,700
well I mean going to and make

243
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,200
okay so how you got the young in the
first place

244
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,380
I said you people like telling everyone
to do YUM

245
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,370
so I D just did at getting star YUM

246
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,070
why can't you just apt-get install gcc
instead

247
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:37,220
but yep that's a part of the whole
process so we as human that the student

248
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,520
knows the difference between

249
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,700
back to use the arm already used the CC

250
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,490
out wrong adamson so did this we just
think that everyone knows nothing

251
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,240
and let's start from the scratch people
who can pick up fast don't pick up fast

252
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,240
but we is the program based on all
students

253
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,770
okay how to manage fifty-plus students
on as the channel

254
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,450
this is something was not I we
discovered we just reused

255
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,130
the process we each we have been fed our
project

256
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,520
so Peter project has this meeting rooms
Federer had been meeting figure I've

257
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,800
been meeting had been one

258
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,640
when we get many people at the same time
and by gays that person we speaking

259
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,910
domain are bus and we think year

260
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,020
he or she will be keep talking and other
people if they have any question do in

261
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,480
just died a clinician mark then the
moderate and the person who isn't here

262
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,930
in our case our trainers they would see
does exclamation marks and they will

263
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,089
allow people are asked people to speak
up and the students with end with that

264
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:41,839
yo mouf message

265
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,480
so that we know that he's done we can
say back

266
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,180
and along with eighty-plus student it
worked really well

267
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,500
there was never ever any problem where
make

268
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,830
following the roots but we had to mix
your dad the rule is being followed

269
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,640
strictly

270
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:03,029
if not we just saw back with gaps

271
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,380
to as I said let wheat when it comes to
burp

272
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,899
programming and bring stuff and I new
people coming up

273
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:13,309
a lot with this problem

274
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,409
in addition issues so don't try to solve
it dear

275
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:21,270
just teach them some beta radiators it
can be any edta can be just type in

276
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,279
notebook

277
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,079
that release all the New People's inland
is an issue

278
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:33,079
totally do not have that problem at all

279
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:36,929
sold reelect problems during the NECA
project is

280
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,489
we asked the students to solve problems
which are baiting yet dude im

281
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:44,509
instead the problems like any
mathematical quise or any other problems

282
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:46,480
which we think is good

283
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,899
to with the last few years we saw people
solving

284
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:53,749
are creating programs too late
downloading subtitles for the movies

285
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:54,679
they have

286
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,220
are one student actually an wrote that
cool

287
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,299
who scrap through all his movie
selection

288
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:04,759
getting all the meter data from IMDB and
so kissing in a nice

289
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,470
you right people are writing note-taking
applications

290
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,610
our system monitoring tool

291
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,960
compiling C++ programs from Windows to a
Linux box there are some areas

292
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,659
to some simple by conscripts stuff like
that two teams which are very near to

293
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,059
the students

294
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,059
and we believe that's the only way is to
students we love

295
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:30,049
the problem statement audited maybe just
some problem which is given by the

296
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:30,889
teacher

297
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:34,909
to talk but in this where do we find oh
this is something

298
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:38,389
can help me too on my friends too and
they can write it

299
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:41,950
and they can actually talk to the
students

300
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,539
other friend students

301
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,980
one big thing in our program superheroes

302
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,210
so for us the superheroes that they are
other

303
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,779
contributors were doing great things for
us for a long time

304
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:58,919
so we call this missile system says
guess since

305
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,200
our guest lectures where people from of
deemed

306
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,919
diplomat are any kind up often projects
come over and keep talks

307
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,330
most of the talks are on in general Lake
howdy started LA from zero knowledge to

308
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,539
where they are now direct talks on

309
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:20,889
see Creative Commons license
documentations licensing in general

310
00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:23,970
last year nicole blood started that
talks

311
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,279
I'm his talk was the first Catholic
decision

312
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,309
this year hopefully many about that by
cannisters we come over and

313
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:36,869
gives isn't like this this actually
helps the students to

314
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:41,779
stain doctor to see that Dec person I
known that name

315
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,860
who wrote all these applications is
actually do. person

316
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,159
I can talk to him or her and I can ask
anything

317
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,659
so that gives them a much more
confidence so we try to sell them that

318
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,389
give them hope give them heroes

319
00:19:54,389 --> 00:20:01,009
so that they can follow and they can
become better heal

320
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:05,039
we have a small home task and submission
system which is written in by 10

321
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,129
I'll I passed the link later on

322
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:12,559
so from all the strings what they found

323
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,080
people who are contributing to projects
like Federer Katie

324
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,379
OpenStreetMap people who are in
companies like a red hat Amazon

325
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:25,679
and Yahoo the new startups coming up and
all across the Indian IT service

326
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,070
companies

327
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,409
they got picked up baby faced which was

328
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:34,619
kinda followed going to actually get
this going to be just oppan

329
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:38,379
running

330
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:43,399
musically to that the things I think
wanted to talk about and

331
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:47,159
if you have pictures on doing the
questions I just want to take some

332
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:48,190
questions if they're

333
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,789
did a few students from the different
rating systems we just think in their

334
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:52,629
pictures

335
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:57,830
just before this bike on so that we can
just predicted there

336
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,700
we find like this guy he started as a
translator

337
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,549
it doesn't too fast but I'm and from
there I think he's doing a lot of

338
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:09,690
OpenStack nomination work I think he was
the second-highest coming during the

339
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,419
documentation

340
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:14,200

341
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,659
just like that we we do have are
sometimes questions if anybody's got one

342
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:26,659

that's not a stalker actually just died
Bangla back its and baby you if

347
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,570
just so that we can understand the
message is over book messages over and

348
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,999
the second reason

349
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,230
and of something F on Lake

350
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,859
you can type I don't know that
indomethacin to fight

351
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:59,429
okay like that he said that you have
students come in with

352
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:03,039
problems that they want us all the you
you actually require that is part of it

353
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,470
are

354
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,590
X we tried to do that before with
educational efforts were you want people

355
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,359
come in with the project

356
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:12,619
not mine are actually no because not
everyone can come up with ideas

357
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:16,799
it will be Lake are the forty maybe five
or six we come up with their own I guess

358
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,720
rip artist up then we have some think
little bit similar kind of things

359
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,690
but we take it was them like what you
like next spent 15 defense 120 days and

360
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,409
fined 02

361
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:30,029
what kinda problems you have in your
daily life we try to talk a lot

362
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:33,690
where C get an ex its cuz we we had the
same problem not a not everybody's gonna

363
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,600
come up with an idea and I was always
kinda

364
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,809
a challenge yeah it's always a big
challenge

365
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,190
hi kinda good me

366
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,489
hi turned into that arm when you come up
for the challenge and they were coming

367
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:49,539
up the challenges

368
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:54,989
did you find a week with conceptual I
call the computer scientist and social

369
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,909
things they need to learn did you find
that

370
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:01,080
they were gone and miss some gap so that
all or the pollen said end up covering

371
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,059
all the gaps

372
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:06,809
I of course they're going to be some
gaps so during this isn't what we also

373
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:09,499
do is to pass them different book names

374
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:13,489
which meeting can give them some basic
idea say about opening systems

375
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:16,980
sale data structures what are these
things time to time

376
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,899
and we try to push them to other late
whatever be elected to be fine

377
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,350
which are useful things like that
because on leader maybe

378
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:28,019
I mean not everyone can actually learn
those things writing only solving

379
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:29,330
problems

380
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,899
but still relates problems is lead we
give them a chance to learn things

381
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:38,950
for example if you are writing a program
which and one game maybe

382
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,289
they can number guessing or something
would you want to give it be up free

383
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:43,249
next

384
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:46,259
so you have to learn about packaging
that how to pack is that thing so that

385
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,710
you can actually give it back ross

386
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:53,220
your friend so you have to do that and
learn something out of it

387
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,879
get up I actually Evelyn question one
other things it comes up

388
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:01,139
somewhat frequently is are people who
are kinda want to jump into

389
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,929
open source but don't miss reno what
project

390
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:08,989
to you dude you have advice that you can
give to the PPS doing your seems

391
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:13,059
yet how to go about that so what we do
is we just to try to keep a track of the

392
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:16,320
students how they're performing what are
the kind of things they like

393
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,820
because we not only talk about
programming and computer we talk I would

394
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,700
natural thing sold

395
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,109
I mean normal things what did we daily
life kind of thing start to become

396
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:25,479
friends to them

397
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:28,739
so that we can identify the points
liquid kind of things the lake do the

398
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:30,440
lake to use going on What Katie

399
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,929
would you like use gonna get easily May
12 men don't learn a little bit of sleep

400
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:34,809
last night

401
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:37,820
here at the feelings which can study
this if you have a problem

402
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,289
hear the people in our group who can
help you with the simplest most def

403
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:44,649
and from this lonely stepping up because

404
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,149
otherwise it's that like problem
identify that thing

405
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:52,119
because that's the question every time
it comes up so aseptic unknown if you

406
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,009
said his name

407
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:57,679
he has wanna bet a document called I you
want to do a project what should I do

408
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,840
now or something

409
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,330
so he actually explained it in that
completely that if you want to do a

410
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,970
project what are the steps

411
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:08,159
just follow it up there well if there's
no more questions

412
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,729
but something crucial thank you sky
