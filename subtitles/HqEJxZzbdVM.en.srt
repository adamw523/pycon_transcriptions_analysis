1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,450
I'll I we had

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,889
her and she's here in stage and I'll
talk to us about how to turn your

3
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:13,410
computer into a server

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,349
peace will come

5
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,660
hi

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,050
the okay alright a high

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,289
I'm Karen I'm a freelance web developer
based in Mountain View Calif

8
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,480
hi I'm a sheepish I'm a security
engineer at event bright in San

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,169
Francisco

10
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:36,140
yeah but by people in the middle yeah

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,410
the this is turn your computer into the
server it's in introductory level talk

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,940
and we have three main goals for the
stalk

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,120
that first by the end of it you have a
basic understanding

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,270
love computer networking on you

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,680
believe that if you have a computer they
can access the Internet

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,870
you can run a server on it and you some
ideas how to do so

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,920
and family you have faith that you can
do this

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,250
and not get immediately hacked or have
you can get a break

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,970
or anything terribly awful bad happen so

20
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,100
30 parts the stock the first part

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,200
is about simple sharing sharing in
progress work or files from

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,539
your work computer and either

23
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:21,970
within a given network or across
networks and

24
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,050
part 2 will talk about home servers
which is a case where you want it to be

25
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,119
up basically all

26
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,179
time versus just one of connections and

27
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:33,539
the specific considerations associated
that use case

28
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:36,989
so but Medina scenario

29
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:39,989
your building your first web application

30
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:44,289
inlets a Django and you run

31
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:47,479
United tutorial you run the built-in web
server

32
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,209
command and the tutorial policing go to
this

33
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,479
local host corn 8,000 address in your
browser see do so

34
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,550
and you see your django application show
up

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,090
that's pretty exciting in fact you're so
excited

36
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,459
and I may or may not have done this
myself a

37
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,440
you quickly copy and paste the link
insanity remade to show off your work

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,420
I've course you quickly realize this
isn't going to work

39
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,379
local host that that only works on my
computer it's not going to be seen by

40
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,239
anybody else

41
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,379
so okay well you get clever

42
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,829
you like well I know the name of my
computer like and

43
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:28,439
so our place local host with my computer
that local in the URL

44
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,040
and that's going to work right well

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,510
not exactly and so your

46
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,489
roommates still can't see your django
application that you want to show off to

47
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:39,840
them

48
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,450
so to figure out why that didn't work
and how to fix it

49
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,299
we're gonna look a different tool for
basic local sharing

50
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:50,379
which is called simple issues P server

51
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,430
this is a model built and built-in comes
a pipe on

52
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,579
you have it on your computer if you
papon and the way the

53
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:01,650
use its is you go into a given directory

54
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,290
you run this command and files within a
directory will be served

55
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,780
by default template thousand you can
specify the port and

56
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,879
this is a really useful tool for doing
in sharing

57
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,629
fun and projects it smell CSS JavaScript
on

58
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,370
or basic file sharing and what's neat
about it

59
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,760
is it doesn't just work at local host
Hornets thousand

60
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,700
it works even at my computer that local
colony thousand

61
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,079
so this works but

62
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,950
the Jenga built-in server doesn't so
let's compare the two and figure out how

63
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,790
we can make

64
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,480
the Django built-in server act like this
simply

65
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,639
TP server so when we look at the log
message:

66
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,469
that we get when we run the simple HTTP
Server we get

67
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:49,049
serving HTTP at on

68
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,379
0 to 0 to 0 to 0 port a thousand

69
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,519
and I don't really know this 40 think

70
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,279
a but when I compare it to the Django
log message:

71
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:04,099
but I get there's a bunch of stuff and
it says it's serving at 127 dot the road

72
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,200
at 0 to 1

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,650
it doesn't have their daughter died 02 0
whatever that is

74
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,389
well you might try something other and

75
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:16,480
in be run server command instead of just
specifying the port

76
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,880
you might try putting the 40 thing in
front of it so it looks like this

77
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,040
and in the lot method you can see that
is no longer serving at 127

78
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,090
it serving at zeroed out there that
they're out at zero

79
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,030
cool so what to do that experiment

80
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,720
you ask your roommate to try again my
computer that local and

81
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,520
they see what you see they see your day
go out the kitchen that's pretty cool

82
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,730
it works but we still don't know why or
what

83
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,970
dur da dur da dur that 0 which employs
six saying

84
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,820
means though to explain we need to
discuss

85
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,600
a talk about a bit about how ports and
interfaces work in computer networking

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,960
you might already be familiar with ports
might've heard them

87
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,400
heard of them at least its easy to
conceptualize them

88
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,920
as these gateways a

89
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,290
a these entryways and your computer are
numbered

90
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,560
numbered 1 through over 60,000

91
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,190
and so they're not all John here

92
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,740
and different applications will listen
or buy into

93
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,340
different ports and so we know Django's
listening

94
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,910
to 40,000 and so it's listening for
requests to come in

95
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,090
a from outside the computer and sending
responses

96
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,150
moralist so that sort of our basic model
what ports are

97
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,830
the reality is actually a little bit
more complicated because you don't just

98
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,820
supports

99
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,830
you also have interfaces so really looks
more

100
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,820
something like this um these the what an
interface is

101
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,580
is a way that your computer get online
so here

102
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,700
this computer has three interfaces
there's wn2

103
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,450
which is your wireless card there's eth1
which is your internet connection

104
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,640
and then there's hello which is local
loopback

105
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,690
which is sort of a virtual interface you
can't actually connected from outside

106
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,160
it only works inside your computer and
so

107
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,810
each up these interfaces have their own
bankers ports

108
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,290
on you don't just have one port a
thousand you have in this case 3

109
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,640
you can see what interfaces your
computer has and some information about

110
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,360
them

111
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,380
if you run the command I F config on the
command line

112
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,890
on most you next the system's and I'll
give you some useful information about

113
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,470
your computer on so

114
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,760
we can see here that the reason why

115
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,920
with the default Django run server setup

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,330
your roommate wasn't able to see it is
by default only binds to port 8000

117
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,280
on the local loopback interface which
you're able to access via local host

118
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,230
but when your roommate rise their
connecting over the wifi

119
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,320
its checking a completely different port
8000 and nothing's listening there

120
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,200
were not able to connect what the 0 to 0
to 0 to 0

121
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,910
a shorthand means is bind to the sport

122
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,150
on all available interfaces and so
django does so

123
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,340
and for now you can connect

124
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,880
over local host and a roommate can
connect over WiFi and if we had people

125
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,780
connected on even if they could get
there too

126
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,800
pretty cool so

127
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,040
great we've accomplish our first or we
can show off her work

128
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,010
and show off how awesome your Django
programming skills art your roommate

129
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,410
or anyone else who happens to be on the
same network but

130
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,540
we've got a friends who don't live with
us who don't share wifi

131
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,950
a were elsewhere on the internet that we
also want to show off to you

132
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,670
and so we need different tools to be
able to communicate with them

133
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,060
am in order understand both

134
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,890
to understand how to do this we need the
first discuss IP addresses

135
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,010
a Internet Protocol addresses am

136
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,030
these are what are used for routing on
the Internet and there's two kinds

137
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,870
the first is private IP addresses which
exist within a given network

138
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,580
so if we imagine that this is your
network at home

139
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,960
um is your wifi router and there's you
and your roommate

140
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,830
and then the router standing between you
and the rest the Internet

141
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,650
private IP addresses only apply on the
left side with the

142
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,110
diagram between you and the router

143
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,780
on certain IP address blocks are
assigned to be private I'd

144
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,849
private addresses so if you see an
address starts with 19 2.1 6 8

145
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,760
or was her 172 dot some stuff

146
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,349
or 10 doubt stuff and that means you're
looking at a private address not a

147
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:43,019
public address

148
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,560
and you can find out what your
computer's private IP address

149
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,459
another is a number ways if configured
value for one

150
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,439
another way is using are simply CP
server that we're

151
00:08:55,439 --> 00:09:00,860
doing for when you run it and you access
it over local host

152
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,199
when you look at the log message in the
terminal window you'll see one thing

153
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,019
you'll see it

154
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,939
a connection from 127 that the road out
there that what from local host

155
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:12,800
but when you connect over my computer at
local instead you'll see something else

156
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,029
the logs

157
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:18,949
you'll see 172 in this case that 27 that
the road at 14 and that is your private

158
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:19,889
IP address

159
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:23,029
on the network you're currently
connected to so

160
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,509
that's pretty cool and that means that
you can see roommates private IP address

161
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:27,759
to take an x

162
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,360
over the service you'll see a different
IP address belonging to your roommate

163
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,180
show up there an

164
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,899
yes lets private IP addresses thanks
karen I wanna talk a little bit about

165
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:45,060
public services so website like event
right we don't just want to be available

166
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,689
inside the office montana beach ball
from all over the world

167
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:52,060
for the only thing with the kinda
website you guys wanna work on also

168
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,519
and to make that happen you need to talk
up we need to talk about

169
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,139
public IP addresses which IP addresses
that will route

170
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,889
from anywhere on the internet so karen
mentioned that

171
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:07,339
IP addresses are what the Internet
routes messages based on

172
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,829
which means that if you type in
something like Google to comment your

173
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:12,029
browser

174
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,410
then your brother has to first look up
what the address is

175
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,620
other lot com so that it can send a
message to Google

176
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,920
have the web conversation to show you
the webpage an art show you what that

177
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,689
looks like

178
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,589
through a few her teens and I think that
Lynn route just gave a talk about DNS

179
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:28,110
this is going to be much shorter

180
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,620
dinners %ah but therefore you prolly one
look at hers

181
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,990
in the videos if you haven't so briefly

182
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,779
when you want to visit google.com your
brother sent a message to your home

183
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:39,559
router

184
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,800
and says hey what is the address for
Google com

185
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,050
your router may have it stored may have
a the answer

186
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,160
cached locally maybe look this up
recently

187
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,550
or maybe this is an address that is
based inside your home network

188
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,089
and so it sorta authoritative for the
answer if not

189
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,720
then it passes that request along to the
global DNS service one of the servers

190
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,129
might be Google's one is reversed my
belong to your ISP

191
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,680
eventually an answer comes back which
looks like this

192
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,819
and you rather than pass it along to you

193
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:13,629
so now your browser does what the
address israel %uh com

194
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:17,699
so they can then send a message there

195
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:21,220
but what if you just typed this IP
address into your address bar

196
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,350
will allow to cool here's URL with that

197
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,089
sup and it turns out if you the best yes
you get to go home page

198
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,490
this IP address just interchangeable for
that name

199
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,620
in terms of how the package get there

200
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,740
so for that's great %ah

201
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,189
this mean that you can route packets to
you computers based on names

202
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:46,600
and if you happen one look up a computer
based on his name you can use the

203
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,540
command-line tool called host

204
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,430
which you can query for some particular
name like Google com

205
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,860
and it will tell you what address car
sponsor that

206
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,650
so

207
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,060
alright

208
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,300
%uh so we've seen real web sites have
public IP addresses at least one

209
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,780
public IP address is standing up for any
website or web service

210
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,850
they are able to access over the wider
Internet but your computer

211
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,670
your laptop almost certainly doesn't
have a public IP address

212
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,510
and yet your computer still able to
communicate with the rest the Internet

213
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,560
it able to do so because a trick that
you're at it does

214
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,500
called network address translation
ornette a

215
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,500
and so the way this works going back to
this diagram here's our network

216
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,950
and a router is standing between the
machines on your local network

217
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,700
and the rest to the Internet an
important thing that you're at it needs

218
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,300
to do

219
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,090
is to keep track of who's traffickers
whose you don't want your router's

220
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:46,610
sending

221
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,890
the packets you requested to your
roommate or vice versa the way that

222
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,080
you're at it does this

223
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,610
is so let's look at a request you're
sending a packet to website somewhere on

224
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,280
the internet

225
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,270
books something like this there's among
other

226
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,130
meta-data Thursday to address and the
from address the to address

227
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,890
is the public IP address I'll the
website you trying to access

228
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,280
a ends in a port colon eighty which is

229
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,370
the default port for web services and
the from address

230
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,500
is your private IP address colon some
arbitrary port switch

231
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,800
computer picked out for this particular
TCP connection

232
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,820
the details that aren't important just
that

233
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,440
this particular connection has a
particular port on

234
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,760
so you some material at her rather
what's the packet

235
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,800
and takes the from address that you gave
it

236
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,460
and assigns it to a random

237
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,810
unused port number more less random a
and stores that in the net table

238
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,420
which is stored in your router so here
we were signed

239
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,090
the sport number four for 43 after does
this

240
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,870
it deface is your package a rewrite it

241
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,340
um removes the original from address and
instead

242
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,890
rates the routers public IP address
colon the sport

243
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,530
that it just a sign you after it takes
your

244
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,100
poor defaced packet sent along to the
rest the Internet

245
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,940
hopefully eventually you get a response
back

246
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,000
and course this response isn't obviously
sent to you it sent

247
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,420
to your router's public IP address and I
might have been a lot of requests

248
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,010
between when this was sent

249
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,400
and one you're at it gets the response
and so you're at it needs to figure out

250
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,500
where is this packet suppose to
ultimately go

251
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,700
does this by again looking in

252
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,320
the net table a based on the port number

253
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,150
and okay 4443 is here and corresponds
with this

254
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,140
private IP address a it rewrites the
packet again

255
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,390
to give it your private IP and sent it
along to you

256
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,660
and so this is happening each time
you're making requests

257
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,910
over the network and as far as you can
tell your seamlessly connecting with

258
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,530
Google

259
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,380
even though the packets are getting
changed back and forth by rather

260
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,570
so and that's pretty useful

261
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,190
on the good thing about it is it means
multiple devices can share one public IP

262
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:10,830
address

263
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,830
so if you don't have enough public IP
addresses you can still get

264
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,020
online which is pretty knees I like
being online be bad thing about it

265
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,670
is it makes it hard for people outside
your network to reach you

266
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,200
because you don't have a globally
accessible address you rather just like

267
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,520
I don't know where this goes you can
contact your router but you can't

268
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,150
contact

269
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,510
computers within the route the network
that the router

270
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,960
controls so I would still want to show
to the network

271
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,300
even though we have this difficulty we
need here on this issue and there's

272
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,370
several ways to do so

273
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,470
%uh the first one we're going to talk
about is SSH tunneling

274
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,490
on at this H is

275
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,880
eighty protocol you may have heard a bit
equipped to get graphic protocol that

276
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,870
does a lot of things

277
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,160
the thing that we're doing with it is
called remote port forwarding

278
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,350
and so in order to do this the first
thing you need

279
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,710
is access to a computer somewhere that
does have a public IP address

280
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,020
and as many ways to get access a you
might have

281
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,020
University account that has such access

282
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,190
or line 0 or Amazon ec2 account

283
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,090
or just a friend with the server who's
willing to give you SSH access

284
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:24,100
once you have this are you connect to
the remote machine pssh

285
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,810
this works like any other Internet
connection even if there happens to be

286
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,980
not in the middle

287
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,390
%uh the protocol also connects whatev
reported using for the connection

288
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,460
with the port their application is
running on the specified

289
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,800
so our application is running on twenty
thousand so

290
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,000
were making should pay attention to it
and similarly

291
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,870
we pick out reports that script being
unused on the other machine

292
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,290
in this case port 9,999

293
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,430
and connect to their as well and once
we've done this

294
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,540
then people anywhere on the internet ken

295
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,970
connect to the remote machines IP
address horse domain name it has one

296
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,910
and on the chosen port that that request
will get sent

297
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,270
through the SSH tunnel to your laptop

298
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,740
and group responses back we'll go back
the same way

299
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,790
be indentation on the command line that
does all this look something like this:

300
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,380
um that's our beans do for din of
traffic

301
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,100
St means date reports means use all
interfaces not just local loopback

302
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,280
and then the arguments we have first the
port on the remote machine that we want

303
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,900
to use

304
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,280
where staffers going to be accessible a
what interface port combination that we

305
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,500
want to be connecting on your local
machine

306
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,110
and finally the IP address or domain
name for the remote machine the you're

307
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,760
connecting to

308
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,410
are so great we've got this your L we
can send it to all over friends

309
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,130
and they're going to be able to access
an application that's running

310
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,370
on just your laptop even behind that

311
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,810
all you need to have this access
anywhere on the web

312
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,450
is money to pay for remote server or a
friend who's willing to give you SSH

313
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,620
access

314
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,630
so that works great if you have friends
money or SSH access

315
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,400
but i wanna tell you that my communique
even if you have none of those

316
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,430
on I do notice I'm not super on the wifi

317
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,140
a

318
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,230
we'll see about my demo okay so %ah

319
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,940
there are a couple of services on the
net that are willing to act as relays

320
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,100
for you in the way like an described

321
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,940
they are and rock and paid kite and rock

322
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,289
is designed to help you debug your
applications

323
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,429
anyone can set up whatever demand they
want start

324
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:46,230
and rock dot com and rock have a tunnel
client that they can you that you can

325
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,750
use

326
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,840
kinda like estate client we saw Inc and
example

327
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,950
paid kite is free for open source
developers like five dollars a month or

328
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,510
something

329
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,580
not for everyone else and there

330
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,429
they have a sort of freedom and privacy
bent but look at these anyway

331
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:05,080
our services that you can that we're
willing to broker a tunnel for you

332
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,510
you can borrow some demand from them and
I'll put your website online

333
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,650
and if I were online now i would tell
you all to go to this

334
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,130
URL then you have your computers open
and you are online and you go there

335
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,710
actually

336
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,080
you'll see a message from and rock that
says the tunnel is down

337
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,210
because the wifi sounds years right %ah

338
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,049
but I do have a Django app running on
this machine and i'm happy to show you

339
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:27,570
this

340
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,250
a low it is working ok great so you can
impact go to death

341
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,460
bizarrely okay share

342
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,980
whatever I go to it okay nevermind great

343
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,429
so we have this great angle at my
apologies for

344
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,890
my own stress our meilani

345
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,020
shimon ra and Tony a blow us away had
taken the tanker tutorial

346
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,480
added a few images and put in to give
repo I'm not running that here

347
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,340
the basic pulled up you can go in and
you the existing polls

348
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,330
you can wonder which is the most awesome
not to misuse teaching go

349
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,500
it did somebody break into admin nice
wirklich

350
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,710
of course they did right so in that case
I guess

351
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,230
lawls are better that any ideas and will
vote

352
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:20,450
so I'm glad you all agree but usually

353
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,460
crucially this website mobile talk about
security cynic

354
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,610
I crucially

355
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,280
refresh a not afraid to use I want

356
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,480
up anyway yeah lucien

357
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,289
a look here it is demonstrated that you
can connect to you this laptop running

358
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:38,200
right here

359
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,659
the website even though it says pie
conduct and rock dot com in the address

360
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:42,200
bar

361
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,840
is that a host on my laptop here and

362
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,409
%ah for a while I thought this seemed

363
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:57,150
think

364
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,180
yeah okay go yeah so anyway in the
nineties

365
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,830
%ah I read this fake news article by
fake person

366
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,950
in a pic MIT news magazine about the
coming and

367
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,700
up addresses on the internet %ah and I
thought this is a pretty funny thing

368
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,460
and this article hinges on that idea
that light fixtures will soon

369
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,130
have IP addresses yeah right but then
last year I went to a friend's apartment

370
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,060
and I found with the Phillip Hughes that
you combine for two hundred dollars

371
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,410
at the Apple Store their eighth grade
redid for a5

372
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,600
people seem to like them and they are
Internet address ball

373
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,160
light fixtures so it turns out that we
are really going to run

374
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,390
out if I P version for addresses there
aren't enough

375
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,110
addresses to go around for all the light
bulbs and all mobile phones in the world

376
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,620
in particular the least 6 billion mobile
phones currently deployed

377
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,960
and we don't have that many IP addresses

378
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,790
IP version 4 which is the current most
widely used version of the Internet

379
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,540
Protocol

380
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,680
gives you 32-bit for IP address: which
means that they can be at most

381
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,700
to 232 or about four billion addresses

382
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,910
fewer than the number mobile phones but
luckily also in the nineties

383
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,380
perhaps related to an article that i
read they invented a new version of the

384
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,360
Internet Protocol

385
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,560
IP version 6 and the addresses are so
long but they wanted on the screen

386
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,640
there are 128 bits long they

387
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,040
are there are more IQ version 6
addresses then there are protons

388
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,440
electrons neutrons

389
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,480
particles in the universe so hopefully
will crowd out

390
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,620
this time and %ah

391
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,560
this of course means that there's a next
generation transition that has to happen

392
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,920
now wept for pipe on people here

393
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,950
we're very familiar with the
next-generation transitions

394
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,100
that require backwards compatible
changes and asking everyone to you our

395
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,400
Changer app so that they work according
to the new standards

396
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,340
and IP version 6 have had at least as
much success as pat on three

397
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,020
so I you're a little over a year and a
half ago

398
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,070
fourteen years after the release a IP
version 6

399
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,520
a quarter of a percent all the traffic
to Google's web services were over IP

400
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,260
version 6

401
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,170
not that many %ah results guarantee no

402
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,820
okay but okay right I think that he pee
found that

403
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,120
recently Python 3 accounts for about 1
percent

404
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,450
are a year or so ago I covered in six
accounted for about 1 percent of

405
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,470
Internet traffic but

406
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,950
IP version 6 the doing even better now
were up to you

407
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,910
%ah a tenth a quarter of the Internet
but

408
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,210
%uh the nice thing is that this uptake
is increasing and

409
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,770
if you don't believe me I'll show you
this graph from Google

410
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,080
are you can look this up yourselves but
I'm not as making these up is a really

411
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,860
Google's numbers

412
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,040
so I'm not here just to tell you about
like you were in sixth

413
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,900
because I love it so very much I'm here
to tell you about it because

414
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,880
what it means for getting a computer
online what we've talked about with the

415
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,100
tunneling services

416
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,700
you have to borrow a port or hostname
from somebody from a friend on the

417
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,380
Internet

418
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,090
from and rock dot com assuming their
online and they do this complicated

419
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,430
complicated rewriting track but the way
the internet was supposed to work as you

420
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,350
just show up

421
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,030
on your computer and you get had an
address and then

422
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,390
whatever services you're running are
just available to the entire Internet

423
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,460
and since IP version 6 have so many
under says most

424
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,190
up the as those addresses our public
between the you can find your way

425
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,440
to getting a v6 address right now and
what else is on the verge in six network

426
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,640
can be directly without bother with any
tunnels and there are a few

427
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,740
services that let you do that without
asking for permission my favorite the

428
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,000
is one called me rindo weirdo and its

429
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,390
protocol call Terada or supported on
Windows and Linux systems I think

430
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,340
there's a Mac port

431
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,140
these let you even if you're behind some
network address translation box

432
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,780
sorta fight your way into getting a
virgin take address on your computer

433
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,850
and from that point forward any services
listening

434
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,130
on that version 6 virtual interface on
your computer are accessible globally

435
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,600
without you having to get specific
permission or

436
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,490
proxying for any particular service so

437
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:09,220
I'll take that the back to you so we've
covered a bunch of different ways

438
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,480
but you can share applications or files

439
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,340
on your laptop with people anywhere in
the world or within your network

440
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:22,530
on usually in use cases was just for a
limited time you want to get feedback on

441
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,580
something you made

442
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,730
or just one show off um so its part 10
the stock part 2

443
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:32,690
the stock is about the specific
considerations for a few actually want

444
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,770
to run a machine

445
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,410
at hosting something full time from home
so and always

446
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,720
up caveats server

447
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,340
so like computer ownership in general
Asus admitting

448
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,510
a home server is sometimes fun and
exciting a

449
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,280
sometimes things break sometimes things
crashed a

450
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,590
hopefully your server never looks like
this

451
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,870
the but there are some reasons why

452
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,650
maintaining a home server and having a
dedicated machine for the sort of thing

453
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,830
may be worth it for you so

454
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,990
one thing that you can do the home
servers home automation so maybe you got

455
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,640
a Raspberry Pi last year's icon and
you're excited about

456
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,440
turn your lights on and off or you have
sensors and you want to track your

457
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,490
temperature and humidity in your house
or any number of other things

458
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,660
and what bill to access that information
not just when you're already at home and

459
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,490
you can see that lights are on

460
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,270
but when you're elsewhere and so if
you're going to do that

461
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,580
having a machine that you can contact
from outside

462
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,680
your home all the time is really useful

463
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,740
on you've got this django application
and it doesn't be useful for you

464
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,660
and you want to run all the time simple
as that an

465
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,970
orders services that we often use posted
by other people

466
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,160
but you may want to host them yourself
for a variety of reasons

467
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,160
increase control increase privacy in the
current regulatory environment

468
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,670
it's a lot harder for emails gets nuked
if they're literally in your house

469
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,840
and and similarly you can run

470
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,100
I your own web services at home %uh so
your bookmarks your RSS

471
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,660
notes photos but music all sorts of
things

472
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,060
and live right ive examples of services
even poster self

473
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,320
they're open source for those sorts
applications and

474
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,420
the added benefit with those is not just
increase privacy in control

475
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,430
specifically you don't have to worry
about your favorite service getting

476
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,710
Carlos Lee shut down by some large tech

477
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,450
longer than just bought the startup but
does the thing that you love

478
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,450
on if you control yourself and host
yourself that's never going to happen a

479
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,200
must

480
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,870
your house will get spotted

481
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,330
a so that yet so there's some some

482
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,180
site Solus benefits to having home
servers and being able to do this

483
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,490
on and so sheesh is going to demonstrate
one service

484
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,800
that so %ah

485
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,660
if you have that web service at high
combat and rock dot com

486
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,560
you remember that it's only available
from I it's available via a tunnel

487
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,990
that means that it could go down if that
tunnel fails but i wanna talk with you

488
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,730
about

489
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,860
is hosting that in a way where your home
network

490
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,560
make sure that stays up consistently so

491
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:23,010
for this demo will view website at hi
com dot dot the end of story

492
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,340
and with the way to step it up on your
home router is what's called

493
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,830
home port forwarding so let's say that
this tango app is running on your laptop

494
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:35,000
on port 8,000 and you want to be
accessible globally on the Internet

495
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,190
by port eighty which is the normal
that's our report

496
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,910
to do that you would need to configure
something that looks a bit like this

497
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,300
you need to tell your home router
whenever packets arrive destined for

498
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,730
poor eighty

499
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,670
turn them over to my computer on port
8000 and would need to make this rule

500
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,810
somehow permanent

501
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,890
not just transitory while a connection
it made and a way to do this

502
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,420
is called port forwarding free router
and I'll show you what that looks like

503
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,800
in the assure that looks like when
packets both room

504
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,340
when they arrive they're destined to the
router on port 80 because no one on the

505
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,070
Internet

506
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,120
outside her home knows about your
internal address

507
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,570
the rather look that this port
forwarding rule and rewrites the packet

508
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,990
and send it off to you and then your
computer will respond

509
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,300
nationally through the router so

510
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,180
to configure something like that you
need a at you need to log into your

511
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,670
home wifi router and you'll find
interface that looks kinda like this

512
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,350
you'll see there's a bunch of options
here what's important is that the

513
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,480
external port is that

514
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,920
eighty the internal ports at eight
thousand and internal IP address

515
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,870
is set to the address your laptop inside
the network there's also the drop down

516
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,000
about TCP and maybe other things

517
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,100
for the purposes of this talk TCP is the
only right answer that

518
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,200
but for different services you much is
something else you can read about this

519
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,000
later

520
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,820
in order to people to reach your service
though they're going to need to know

521
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,700
what the address above your Radaris so
you need to know

522
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,520
what is my IP now if you just asked this
tool I F configure on your computer

523
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,190
ill show you your computer's internal IP
on your network if you actually Google

524
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,630
for this question

525
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,950
the Google servers will be happy to tell
you do that people will say

526
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,350
in the surface parties your public IP
addresses

527
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,090
whatever it is and if you want to get
that automatically

528
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:29,110
through some kind give API there are
services that let you do that to you

529
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,140
so this is great for letting people surf
to the routers IP address

530
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:37,760
and get routed by a router to your
Django server running inside a network

531
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,770
but if you want to give them some nice
to main like this

532
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,950
hi conduct and after Oregon address

533
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,570
then you need to register that somehow
so

534
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,000
there are these so-called dynamic DNS
services

535
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,650
for example ducked in ass this is the
logo by the way I'll be hatin support

536
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,060
questions for them in the answer them
really quickly

537
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,530
on their Google+ community and added new
features for us there happen to be free

538
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,580
but the cool thing about dynamic DNS
services in general

539
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:09,450
is that if your home routers IP address
changes for whatever reason let's say

540
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,840
you turn it off and on and as a result
you gonna sign in your address

541
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,440
these things make it really easy to
update your DNS name

542
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,110
with the new address

543
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:25,020
out so up that's all great for

544
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,510
letting people route to your server but
if they happen to do a lot with it if

545
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,000
they

546
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,540
send you are requesting you happen to
respond %ah

547
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,100
there might be some limitations and
they're probably some limitations that

548
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,090
is being inside the hike on network here

549
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,210
so all I can talk about that and yeah

550
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,679
so you can imagine with are Django polls
at

551
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,670
if the images on the app works

552
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,080
we don't resize them properly their full
size huge and

553
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,250
lots of people wanted to use our POS
application at once

554
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,610
then that could be kind of a drag and so
with the limitations associate with

555
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,310
running home server the first one of
course is banned with

556
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,770
on any traffic either requests to your

557
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,140
server or people applauding files to
your server if it's now position that

558
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,890
does that

559
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,070
will use up your home and with which

560
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,290
if two extremes I can interfere with
your regular

561
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:19,480
with anyone else on your network surfing
or using the Internet

562
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,560
normally an important thing to be

563
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,850
aware within that is others term called
buffer bloat

564
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,230
which is something especially bad with
Ben with that happened

565
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,150
if you're dealing with large files I
where the large file world

566
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,990
get privileged in its loading but like
regular tiny requests will just like

567
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,550
get backed up behind not be terrible
obsessed with googling

568
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:46,360
I'm sensible router a configuration can

569
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,560
make up for both these in partially
mitigate them another thing to be aware

570
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,040
is called is max connections so when
you're running a service

571
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,419
under computer on many services

572
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:02,650
can really take basically all the
connections you can throw at them

573
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,760
if you're hosting some static files with
Apache

574
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,169
it'll be fine the traffic is it where
you have to worry about well you have to

575
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:11,730
worry about more so is your home router

576
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:16,120
most home routers will not put up very
well with having hundreds of connections

577
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,520
per second coming in

578
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,590
pouring and sometimes even left them at
depending on the router

579
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:24,010
um what will happen is the net table

580
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,290
which we saw earlier in the diagrams
will fill up

581
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,100
and out when that happens then either
you can't just can't make any more

582
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,820
connections

583
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,190
or existing connections get dropped on
the floor neither which is very good

584
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,390
if you've ever had to restart your
router after someone on your network use

585
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,620
bit torrent

586
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,810
that the very similar phenomenon were
too many connections are just

587
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,790
making a router break am

588
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,980
your internet service provider may have
rules about where large do on your

589
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,740
network

590
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,290
on for example until relatively recently
Google fiber's Terms of Service will not

591
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,030
allow you to run home server

592
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,810
and so that's something to be aware
similarly some ISP's

593
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,310
filter certain ports before they even
get your house

594
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,730
on port 25 the default port for email

595
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:12,300
is blocks both incoming and outgoing by
many eyes peas

596
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,970
so if you want to host your own email
you're going to have to do some sort of

597
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,300
work around to get around that

598
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,750
and so that's just limitations things
that can go all wrong

599
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,990
or slow down your home internet are just
kind of a pain

600
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,120
but there's also security considerations
were someone

601
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,609
the faces you about ligation or breaks
into the database behind a web

602
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:33,520
application

603
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,870
and can thus do various things and so
I'm going to lead

604
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,910
event bright security engineer sheesh
attack about those

605
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:46,780
thanks although it almost seems like we
should have Luke talk about them

606
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,940
unfortunately I have the mic tho a there
are some risks that applied to any and

607
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,230
service weather is running on your home
computer

608
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,690
weather is running on the Internet in
the cloud rack in a data center

609
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,060
however are one of the most important
things you might care about your web app

610
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,680
is that it actually stay online it what
you don't want is for people to show up

611
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,650
to your web at

612
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,220
and a center seeing your beautiful
images they see a broken image icon

613
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,810
this is bite happen to you if your
website gets too popular

614
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,960
up for all sorts of reasons on

615
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,130
another problem that might occur is that
users might be able to break into each

616
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,240
other's information

617
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,660
so this could happen if users that bad
passwords

618
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,470
it could also happen if there's some
like was probably what we did by the way

619
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,690
%ah thanks a lot shimon inmate who set
up that demo

620
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,859
have a and it also might happen

621
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:42,100
if you fight if somebody find the
security bug in the code that you're

622
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,150
running

623
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,900
the something else have you ever which
is that most frameworks have settings

624
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,240
that you can set

625
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,780
to you make the app be running in a way
in a way that safe

626
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,290
for other people to access Django had a
debug equals

627
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,340
line that you can set to true or false
if you set it to true

628
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,100
then if any then if you tell that 20
Janko

629
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,859
or contributors will be like know how
could you do that because the

630
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:10,390
documentation has very clearly not to it
says to set it to false if you plead on

631
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:10,870
trust

632
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,750
are accessing the site the thing is that
if your running stuff at home there's

633
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,010
more stuff at risk

634
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,450
if somebody breaks into that service at
your house

635
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,670
hypothetically they can read all sorts
of havoc they could change your home

636
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,700
wifi router

637
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,900
so that when you go to wipe it is like
e-bay what you see

638
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,710
is all the images come back upside down
that it will get for this

639
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,000
I'll give you the week after that you
want Kathleen Q&A

640
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,580
but are given that there are

641
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,990
us a few considerations apply
specifically to running stuff at home

642
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,090
and they apply to the security of your
router and your computer in particular

643
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:48,710
so if you rather have the week admin
password

644
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,750
and somebody breaks into the web app or
other services you're running

645
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,280
they can then log in to your other
change your password

646
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,340
or reconfigure it they can also attack
other computers

647
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,290
and with a serious problem recently
where a bunch a homer

648
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,530
network attached storage like network
hardest boxes

649
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,960
have been broken into like tens or
hundreds of thousands of them

650
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,420
and we're all mining declines so

651
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,480
a their sisters risks about this
actually

652
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,380
they can also break into your computer
particular especially if your running

653
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,010
stuff

654
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,980
the running the web app on your computer
they could then install a keylogger and

655
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,660
record all your keystrokes

656
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,530
decade install mouth recorders and see
all the things you're clicking around

657
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,030
and so on

658
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,080
someone talk for a bit about how to
mitigate those in a few minutes we have

659
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,020
left

660
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,880
wanna most important things is to stay
up to date so

661
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,630
are ten years ago I was running a wiki
call TWiki

662
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,130
that was my personal website on Home
Server and

663
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,480
then a few days job well at one point

664
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,210
I discovered my server was being used to
send out spam

665
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,850
and this is because basically I haven't
upgraded my wiki there is a publicly

666
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,790
announce security vulnerability where
people could run whatever they want

667
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,260
by misusing the version control feature

668
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,260
not sitting and not staying up-to-date I
had to go clean up after that you're in

669
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,720
total mass

670
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,770
upgrade the second thing that the most
important to say

671
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,040
if take backups and backups our way to
recover from whatever crazy thing

672
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,900
happens to your server so

673
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,830
if you have a live replication setup
where any changes may hear automatically

674
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,900
synchronize our second hard disk

675
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,130
then when an attacker break senator lose
all your data that is Emilie

676
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,980
synchronized

677
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,440
your second hardest that's not a backup
you need a way to restore

678
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,850
in his whatever happens not

679
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:38,920
yeah not back tho there are some
particular ways to mitigate

680
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,370
other problems and the key is usually
separating concerned so

681
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:46,089
if you run your home server on your own
computer

682
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:49,120
then at least run inside a different
user account you can use the user's

683
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,400
group features so that

684
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,960
if they do break into that app they
can't go then look at your browsing

685
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,810
history

686
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:58,890
or modify your browser configuration to
give the attacker your Gmail password

687
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:02,270
for example which they could have a
running as your user account and they

688
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,030
had total control

689
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,140
another thing you can do is separated
two runs on a different machine for

690
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,069
example

691
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:11,690
we have a Raspberry Pi my apartment
thanks to my friend keith mcallister

692
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:16,180
which configure which I is responsible
for letting up a great ability is in the

693
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,290
living room

694
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:22,050
and that thing if somebody breaks into
it you can accessorize the after all

695
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,240
that thing can't attack %ah

696
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,310
my personal data that's not stored on
the Raspberry Pi

697
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:32,900
similarly you can isolate networks we've
talked a bit about public and private IP

698
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,819
addresses

699
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:37,260
there's another term you can look into
you call DMZ which is the way to have

700
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,850
a public service on your home network
where it can't reach the internal hosts

701
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,580
so then it wouldn't be able to reach
into your router even if the attacker

702
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,589
had broken and there's a lot more you
can learn about

703
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:52,050
web security in general the open web app
security project

704
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,859
has published list arrests call the top
10 list I recommend reading that

705
00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:00,630
we can also talk talk more after that
after the stock

706
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,130
but having said all this order negative
stuff

707
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:08,140
I wanna say I wanna give you the picture
from the Chaos Computer congress

708
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,960
most the time your home server will be
fine doesn't want ads or at all about

709
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,040
people breaking in

710
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,380
I can avoid that if I upgraded but I
want to tell you one last story

711
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,730
about how things can go wrong and it is
where

712
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,859
a sophomore year in college received a
phone call from my mom

713
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:27,500
and he said pay dinner at home is
running really slowly

714
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,480
I said well I'm here in Baltimore you
out there in Rochester New York

715
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,990
how can I possibly help maybe the
neighbors are using the wifi lot maybe

716
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,560
the new network in town you need to
change

717
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,960
that wifi channel I don't know so I hung
up

718
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,380
and I want to be my email and I couldn't

719
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,620
I realize but you know is hosted in my
parents basement on Home Server

720
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,800
they might be onto something here and

721
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,400
when nothing else to do a district
website on myself Google

722
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,020
a new website do love the day with metal
products that so

723
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,710
i click to their happened click on the
Google Image Search tab

724
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:08,220
analysts are really familiar picture in
the top bro the images search

725
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,160
and this picture I realized for the
photo about a picture of the Mandelbrot

726
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,790
set

727
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,790
the my friend Jonathan had put on my
home server

728
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,830
on his personal hosting account there
for a high school product he made into

729
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,900
this class

730
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,920
so I click on that and lo and behold
really slow to load

731
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,400
so that I was going on there Ubuntu
random people really excited by Google

732
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,520
by Mandelbrot set and tried to load the
serb

733
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,240
server page in my parents basement
eventually allowed into that server

734
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,160
and I set up a redirect to that that
image got served not my parents basement

735
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,870
and everything handled the helpline this
is by and large one of the worst or as I

736
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,770
can tell you

737
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,850
so it's really there's not that much to
panic about especially if you do the

738
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,920
kind of separation we talked about

739
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,810
so that's all we have for you today I
hope that we left you with these

740
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,900
takeaways that you understand basic
networking now

741
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,060
that you know that if you're online you
can use tunnels are other mechanisms

742
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,130
to run a server and you understand the
basics on how to do so safely

743
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,970
so with that said we're happy to take
questions I will say that we have the

744
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,780
slides and also have the video

745
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,780
at this domain here I'm sorry donna
thanks

746
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,190
0

747
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:26,089
par top like 0

748
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:31,060
her there

749
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:36,630
I can governors hi karen is sheesh thank
you so much for your talk

750
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:41,210
I feel a lot more jazzed about running
stuff from my home

751
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:45,390
on I want to ask I'll whether you think
that

752
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,670
stand-alone appliances like freedom box

753
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,650
are things that people would wanna look
into right now are they do you happen to

754
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,490
know whether they're ready

755
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,080
or do you think that running something
from something like a Raspberry Pi

756
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,910
or or your own via tower laptop would be

757
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,770
the best way to go for stuff like
hosting hosting an email hosting and

758
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,800
photo stuff like that

759
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,240
so i cant yet so the question is about

760
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,080
%uh stand-alone boxes that's come
pre-configured with

761
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,960
home server software for example for the
box um

762
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,190
so I have no particular experience
running a bit about software but in

763
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:22,680
general

764
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,750
is kinda Raspberry Pi like machine that
runs

765
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,600
a Debian based operating system I think
that

766
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,280
at least right now it's good to
understand what's going on

767
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,870
and so I think that installing Debian on
some computer

768
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,800
and learning about log files is a pretty
Duyvil thing to do

769
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,160
and at that point mostly you are getting
that much by running

770
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,980
the zone 1 cats but then again I've been
running Debian since 2001

771
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,280
so you are my different opinions try
whatever you want I mean

772
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,820
yes so I'm excited about the PM box
project a lot and similar products like

773
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,150
it

774
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,340
a I think everyone should run stuff but

775
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,760
a I don't have that much experience with
what

776
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,230
the experience in running one is like at
this point a

777
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,470
and I do think it's important to know
how the freedom box like any other

778
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:11,860
machine you would read homeworks

779
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,080
so that's on my dick one other quick
addition is that

780
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,200
whether or not you're using some
standard appliance

781
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,220
upgrading matters an extremely large
amount

782
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,960
otherwise your commercially configured

783
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,710
home network appliance storage network
attached storage box will be mine back

784
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,230
lines

785
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:35,230
I was actually looking good

786
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:38,390
%um runnings up

787
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:41,820
and I was very route couple weeks ago
next system

788
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,150
Ross P&P which seems said

789
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,470
things didn't mention that for example

790
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,170
basically all routers p and equipped

791
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,330
you can just I think it is packing the
next

792
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:02,340
used talk to you water and to get the
external appeared

793
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,570
anything just from the applied and then
you can actually say

794
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,640
would

795
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:16,640
this total yes and it's completely
automated

796
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:21,330
soul would you recommend using that said

797
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:25,310
you know about you think it's a good
idea to go down yeah

798
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:29,260
said to repeat that there's a protocol
call UPnP

799
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,840
are universal plug and play much let's
applications inside your home network

800
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,420
configure the router without you logging
into the router's admin interface

801
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,790
and the question was is that great and
the answer is that is great

802
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:44,150
yeah we didn't mention it here be

803
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:48,010
cuz I've never used it basically I'm so
you sick looking around configuring

804
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:52,920
also you can like write a python script
to get stuff from it but it's not

805
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,930
integrated into

806
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:58,230
Django or anything else so you need to
be aware that stuff anyway

807
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:04,640
be are you can't you can be a shortcut
is

808
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,960
thanks for putting stop up to talk a
little bit more about the

809
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,730
units this morning freed or

810
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:17,570
and how does dan yes compare read

811
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:22,930
so I'm

812
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,820
Saint sure whatever a.m. yes so I guess

813
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:31,120
the distinction between as a shelling
and dynamic dns which may reading

814
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,380
super get in the talk is the idea

815
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,890
a like I do you just wanna send people
to a port

816
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,810
random port somewhere in time domain is
that good enough or a subdomain if it's

817
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:42,770
a service like

818
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:46,000
I am service like and rock

819
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,530
or would you rather have your own domain
name that you want

820
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,330
to get sent to forward to your home
server

821
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,650
and if you're setting that up you're
going to need a

822
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,220
you know be make sure that your domain
name is able to

823
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,210
stay in contact with your home IP and
since your router's IP address often

824
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:04,970
changes

825
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:08,640
um SonoSite only cheated once years and
have the jitters are a few weeks

826
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,070
depends on your eyes P dynamic dns

827
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:16,360
is necessary just to make sure that your
domain name is still pointing at the

828
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,010
right thing

829
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,250
and so that sorted in general what a
dynamic DNS server does

830
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:25,230
a service does and so ducked you know
it's also gives you the domain name

831
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,890
you could use your own domain name with
the service as well I believe you

832
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:32,780
fire name record yeah okay our

833
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:37,540
yet so that's where the distinction
where's the tunnel is

834
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,430
while you're gonna need a port number
Ford and it's gonna be on someone else's

835
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,470
domain

836
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:44,500
while us and just add one other thought

837
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,860
maybe two other quick parts duck DNS to
summarize

838
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,380
is to is just a free dynamic DNS service

839
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,450
and also I find that my SSH tunnels

840
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,150
sometimes go down when I'm not looking
and that's

841
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,680
why our router port forwarding is what I
would recommend instead of that if you

842
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:10,680
want to make sure it's set up

843
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,030
thank you so much for sometime
