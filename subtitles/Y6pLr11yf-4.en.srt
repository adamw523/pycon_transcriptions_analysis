1
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,559
thank you guys let's start first ball
good afternoon

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,070
by from there's on my name is really
cause great nique

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,340
and I'm I talkin about

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,080
2d/3d graphics with bite on my bile
platforms today

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,680
and when we he reads 33 graphics

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,170
are we usually think about some games

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,790
bottle so it may be not only the game
but some other plications which use

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,800
their graphics-intensive leave I like

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,270
are for educational purposes or write an
all-south for probably three viewer for

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,149
example for

11
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:44,260
engineer which may show some design
staff

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,120
or something like that cell and %ah when
we can't either the use and buy them for

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,100
development some

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,860
our traffic stop for a while reforms
like Android or I was first equation

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,690
which may

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,170
are rises and our minds is why

17
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,550
so why you really we should use the
Python as there are a lot of

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,020
I existent dole's like unity while

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,640
warm many other I game engines which
laws you to do the same

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,390
I just to develop the game I ended male
it will be called cross-platform you may

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,250
do it both for Android and

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,840
chaos well I even have the answers for
this question

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,390
and for us to just for fun yes so

24
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,009
we r LAF will off by found many of us
are

25
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,200
albeit or just make the games for I

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,680
for Holtby and it's very cool really
when you develop something all the

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,460
Python and you my ronit

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,119
on your I am favorite my bile

29
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,530
fall on or your iPod iPad and whatever

30
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,000
and you major do are for example right
now

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,259
there there are some on games the clone
of the games like

32
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:57,479
Aug a clone of their flight departs
which is read on the Python and you may

33
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,560
find eat on them

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,420
are on their goal on Google Play store

35
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,740
and the first second saris and is the
educational purposes cause

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,110
as we all know all the fighting is very
good language for

37
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,680
on educational purposes it's very easy
to learn especially for keys

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,840
and are also there open jail which is

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,890
quiet well maybe it's just me but I
think that it's quite non-trivial staff

40
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,120
and out with up by them for example its

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,769
easier till ornate the because you are
constrained in on the learn in their

42
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,510
open Joe concepts not on their are
buildin

43
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,650
and the bargain this C-plus class called
and stay at

44
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,590
cell really it may be used for are
learning by kids for example

45
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,730
their I use and the pope in jail in
creating the graphic applications which

46
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,510
are maybe a launched on their Obama by
platforms

47
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,769
and second question how which may rise

48
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:58,950
an hour passes how how can we do it so
of fortunately a

49
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,080
we have their key project which was
measured by greed or hunger also

50
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,930
today and I well it's the framework or
other its them

51
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,790
project are which includes a lot of
frameworks and tools which helps you to

52
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,030
grade the cross-platform application

53
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,560
with bite on four different different
platforms

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,330
I didn't lords %ah such such stores like
buy.com for

55
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,390
and Droitwich loss year to year Oct read
the a pic a package

56
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,230
for Android or Kia I'll switch I Los you
to create their

57
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,640
whatever it's called the package for on

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,269
for iPad and so

59
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:43,840
%ah what what's the key via are just
provides for us we may use for our goals

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,819
it first of all

61
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,140
it provide a for a white sauce there are
ported

62
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,879
by from core which is the by them either
but there are I was just bored

63
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:57,840
for are any platform like now I ramp
specific for Android or a also we give

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,319
me just

65
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,540
or on aid and Ron any pipeline I

66
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,989
by them called and also it provides them

67
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,349
are robbers around open jail functions
well

68
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,180
are other their OpenGL yes functions cuz
you know

69
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,790
OpenGL ES yes now it's there sup Seattle

70
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,160
they OpenGL for are embedded systems

71
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,419
which are them up I'll platforms as well
sir we have the

72
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,220
by phone interpret their art would have
them our Roberts

73
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,900
of open job functions so in general

74
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,970
art that's all what you what you need to
hear

75
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,380
I'm a graphical applications of your
profession are with

76
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,830
open jail and well I'm a just finished
my talk here

77
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,880
I pop I I'll continue

78
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,520
for their and are I'll explain are which

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,030
another obstructions make you provide to
you now

80
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,419
make your life be easier if you want to
do some

81
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,660
by game with Kenya so first of all yes
just

82
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,660
window are which is the class which
represent them

83
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,550
our screen of the divide Dave device for
the mile device

84
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,889
the whole screen and this all screen is
also the canvas

85
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:13,259
I which way which you may to use for
drawing

86
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,259
our anything you want on this canvas

87
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,229
and also as many other ago where I
libraries have provides the conceptual

88
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:24,330
we jet and each widget I am may its on
canvas

89
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,919
you may also draw or something on the
scandalous in its maybe

90
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,770
art nah stared it may has are its own
side's position so you may locate it

91
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,410
anywhere you want on this credo

92
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,460
screen of them I'll device and drawl
anything you want

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,729
cellco okay sorry I we have right now
they wagered the canvas

94
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:48,190
and all other are things you may need
are located here

95
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,550
in their graphics module all the key
which is written

96
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,970
are on the site and so it may works
quiet

97
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,919
quite fast are for drawing all the
graphics and

98
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,990
out there main likened sapped all

99
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,449
that draw in are something with the
chibi is

100
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,800
instruction art which may be it well

101
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,220
that two main kinds of its auction exist
are

102
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,250
includes the vertex instruction and
can't get in can

103
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,819
back sorry instructions and I'll let me
explain

104
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:22,110
difference are between where them
hot-button

105
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,360
barracks instructions it's something
very I am

106
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,319
very easy it's just there graphical
primitives you may use for

107
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,300
drawing some our ICT and goals gusts
Oracle questline

108
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,410
and I we from this primitive sure your
way

109
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,660
create some more complex image on your
plication

110
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,310
are and at the same time comtex
instructions is something non

111
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,240
not feasible really body it's may impact
of hollow

112
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,960
are their other graphical primitives may
be drawn so it's the collar so you may

113
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,349
just said the caller

114
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,020
all their are graphical primitives which
maybe is drawn

115
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,319
are for their just rotate scale
translate been texture whatever you want

116
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,870
to do that with this

117
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,229
are and let's Lacalle it works are in
the Kiwi

118
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,130
and are in the kiryas sale already
mentioned we will we are working with

119
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,190
the canvas

120
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,180
and we just need to specify Billy stop
the instructions for

121
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,139
each canvas which will be executed while
back and was will be redrawn

122
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:26,949
so are with their with statement weekend
easiest pieces

123
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,870
specified them now number of structures
like cholera

124
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,419
family call or again the lips whatever
you want

125
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,050
are and it will be drawn in this om

126
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,099
in in this canvas and also alternatively
you may just

127
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:45,190
added via the at function to the canvas

128
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,370
arm and yeah there are some

129
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,759
I some properties of this instructions
like position side for its the perfect

130
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,650
angle

131
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,330
which you may on change done that
dynamically

132
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,419
in Europe occasion at it will be redrawn

133
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:07,060
cuz each time you change in their
property of Solace auctions

134
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,310
it's triggered bed redrawing all their
canvas

135
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,300
so you may I just change it the size of
their a

136
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,759
dangle somewhere in in their application
and it will be redrawn

137
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,599
immediately are so you're sure you may
just or two

138
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,120
the instruction to somewhere below and
then use it for the new york occasion

139
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,940
and canvas are is justly so

140
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,320
as I already say the you may specify the
number of destructions

141
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,360
and they will be in the executed in that
sequence you

142
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,940
you just said so are dynamically just
may change

143
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,330
something and you know just IOC change
what they were you want in the canvas

144
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,420
during the execution of the program
which

145
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,089
well by well may be used so om

146
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,370
okay let's let's just I'll show a small

147
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,370
them all are for the primitives

148
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,350
com it doesn't work where fosston
fortunately we have the USB but here's

149
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:02,850
their

150
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,149
simple application I Ron just on the
Android and here's their

151
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,850
on just so recall are rectangle

152
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,120
and triangle which a on drawl

153
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,310
drawn with using of key via and shore

154
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,910
om it maybe not very interesting if you
dont use the textures

155
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,180
and X I use and the pictures with TV
also extremely easy cuz you know

156
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,140
you just need do law the image with
their image class

157
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,850
and I get the picture from me and Seth
for

158
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,330
of 4th for example dangling structure
for any vertex asashoryu mad

159
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:47,810
May said the texture and you'll get
something like

160
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,420
am once second its

161
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,800
lounge location again or K

162
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,019
you may see something like this are

163
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:01,709
sayre in this way you may really IOC

164
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:05,390
creates any duty application

165
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,600
om like game

166
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,660
I am and like in this small game

167
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,230
I just bombed all their all the
graphical style after their

168
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,430
arts I mourn which is the port on the
cheap Mon physical

169
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,829
engine and you may I'm sorry probably

170
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:26,779
works it not because the queue to slow
its because the used

171
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:32,089
slow am okay so yes something like this
you may create also we have

172
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,570
their are with the Kia I'll

173
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,610
bot let's returned to my presentation

174
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,920
so yeah here's the question where's
their open jail

175
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,200
are down if I just show your love
graphical primitives

176
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,810
and I am as ellis et

177
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,209
are you may use all the functions of
OpenGL

178
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:58,940
but its no so here I it may be used with
the special instructions which called

179
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,380
callback and each time when you our
plays the call back

180
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,329
inside of your canvas function well it's
just

181
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:10,720
call it back it's time the cannisters
redrawn

182
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,040
so you may our place any I

183
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,800
GL function like for example I hear
place that they gona Bowl

184
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,769
are jailed up fast function in my call
back

185
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:26,540
and then I it will be called each time
when the canvas actually

186
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,140
drawn so in this way if you are
proficient with a rope in jail you may

187
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,760
create

188
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,579
anything you want are inside of called
back but

189
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:39,180
also as a here out as a mention here
adjuster said

190
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,470
can text I it close to true are it's
very important to do cause you may for

191
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,079
example

192
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,880
break all other stops which should be a
redrawn

193
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,610
after your canvas so are set contains
just

194
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,209
are you know opera set actually can text
to the initial state

195
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:00,779
before your all your OpenGL instructions
was made

196
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,209
and well be well are very useful if you
don't want to crash something the Europe

197
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,380
occasion

198
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,740
arm so yes really I

199
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,769
just I mentioned about then a blend
their jail that fast

200
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:17,790
by the fault in the queue it's not on
the table of if you wanna

201
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,160
do something like this I you're really

202
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,360
need to use enable on DAP

203
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,959
render offer before to on be able

204
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:33,019
do something like 3d staff and let's
meet let me show

205
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,399
very quickly how it may be Don with I
use in the FCIAC

206
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,250
so cute provides your they render
context class which is there

207
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,839
a special canvas which may store all the
variables

208
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,010
I'll which is actually maybe the uniform

209
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,329
variables for your shade or I hope that
someone here

210
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:55,820
know what is shari's on and

211
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,269
here's how it may be you so first phone
just need to create and

212
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:03,540
override the camera so that we jet at
dish detailed at

213
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,920
I really you want to use their render
can text instead of

214
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,709
are usual can was down we need to
specify their path

215
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,779
arthur the shade share their file or
either at their

216
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:19,010
a text all their shape vertex a fragment
shaders itself

217
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:25,339
on and as on the third section I show
how you may easily said the uniform

218
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:27,800
wearables just to set the collar

219
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,040
which is are Rep here

220
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,200
and up some other I

221
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,730
variables like model you matrics and
sure

222
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,949
out there applications Symbian
simplified

223
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:43,970
you weigh looks like bass so you I just

224
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,800
enabling first their jheel they have
then well you

225
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,820
cuite your canvas you should disable its
sure

226
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,769
and inside afraid well it's may be a
good idea to push the metrics cause

227
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,990
if you I you know change their

228
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,269
global matrics you may I again break
something and you're

229
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:05,120
in Europe the cation II and in the

230
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,639
on some vertex instructions place here
you may just

231
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,070
waste some your Red Sox instructions
like mash

232
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,230
for example our way myspace fiber to sis

233
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,910
in dis iz like it's like OpenGL are
concep

234
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,529
and also you should hospice if I there

235
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,449
now for MoP FMT I'll defer motto

236
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:32,649
their I attribute I very bills which
will be used in the shade her and

237
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,779
I'll show you here's if SE if you see I
am

238
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:40,279
spitz find a V posts being normal and V
PC 0

239
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,810
I and then I use well not that we see

240
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,959
heavy this is the Euro our bottom the
first two as their trip with

241
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,570
I variables in my shade or so in this
way you may just

242
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,839
you know greed any mash you wont and

243
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,870
droll any shade there you want to change
are

244
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,029
well yeah do generally whatever arm

245
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:06,310
okay and then in there and way

246
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,810
are get something like this well
actually it's just the Lord at model

247
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,600
from there

248
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,910
arm option file and let me show how it
looks like

249
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,470
on outlooks on their are

250
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,740
my violin rice so here we are

251
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,639
and okay lift-off so

252
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:32,019
I am I may just updated as already
implemented their tation found Sherm

253
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:36,320
on a and well yeah sure and set up this
at you may

254
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,680
face whatever you want and also

255
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,720
are yeah it looks good but not very well
as it

256
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,300
doesn't are in it's not up sorry doesn't
have some textures with pictures

257
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,910
sure it should looks are be better

258
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,769
so here is I they have been in the
textures which

259
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:01,009
also easy are as with previous example
will just plain

260
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:05,509
2d instruction so we just are law the
text sure

261
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:09,100
and arm just said it

262
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,259
are while would create in the mash and
we may get

263
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:16,670
are sound being like and no

264
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,380
at me see

265
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,579
down well yeah here's

266
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,139
screen some yep something like this are
still again

267
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:30,649
hi trance on my device quite fast not

268
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:35,920
started his unfortunately and in Greece
where you mail order any

269
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,399
3d on 3de

270
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,550
model launched bounce some engine

271
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,720
our physical engine and make some

272
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,750
maybe not very on complex but still

273
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,459
are 30-game if you want arm

274
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,529
and are probably its all

275
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:01,199
their obstructions and helpers their
keep plane keeper lights for you

276
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,929
are barred also I just for fun I just
began to you now

277
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:11,309
are doing something like port on the 3GS
if you know this library there

278
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:16,530
Joe strip library are to the key and I
called its q3 and here

279
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,480
that all they are I up provide some more
apps sections like cameras

280
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,600
seen the renders Sol all their arm

281
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,470
sold the staff usually need for are
high-level creation of that 3d

282
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,120
three-year applications well and also as
a

283
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,169
are my families in generally know about
their

284
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:42,700
are graphic obligation which may be used
with Python

285
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,520
I should also mention about some other
products projects like for example

286
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,890
ni forgot or I hold that they pronounce

287
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,710
there Hyundai Motors framework in the
right way

288
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,429
%ah so it's also the engine for creating
the game it's written on the Python

289
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:00,570
inside them as well as the key v

290
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,580
bod its it's based on their is delete
and it doesn't provide you with them

291
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,330
are all OpenGL Rupp robbers or just
functions you may use dutifully

292
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,900
and well it has all the advantages and
disadvantages for 3d for example program

293
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,030
in as there's the L

294
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,289
hair has as is based on need and also
here's the

295
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:25,950
band the 3d very well-known engine are
and

296
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,120
yes the early claimed that on

297
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,360
it may be peeled for Android and now or
send their I

298
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,480
made just create some publication we use
in the this frame or

299
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,929
but first of all I tried it as quiet
non-trivial you know

300
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:44,799
and the the second second point is

301
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,870
that are its you know quite heavy

302
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,890
after completion may take about one
hundred

303
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,000
megabytes so I of for some simple

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,010
3 application it may be quite hairy for

305
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,080
Troy application obviously well

306
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,330
and that's all a half today thank you
very much for attention

307
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:13,330
and

308
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,870
%ah here's their I

309
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,090
purpose or you may follow-on other

310
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,640
for demoss I shown you today and

311
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,310
if someone have a question your just
welcome to you

312
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:36,310
austat you have any questions there's a
micro here in front a

313
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,530
thanks for coming into iraqi there's a
great introduction

314
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,750
I was curious if you knew about pile

315
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:50,250
NGL and whether its I I think I read it
it supports more platforms now and I

316
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,230
wonder if you could use it

317
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,270
with Kitty yet the most complete
possible

318
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,670
up in jail linings hot they do say I did
you say

319
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,880
by by OpenGL right yet sharks lock

320
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,160
of for desktop it's true so you may

321
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,180
place all that by open GL I far chance
inside

322
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,310
call back right I mentioned in my
presentation

323
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,350
and it will work but the problem is hear
that

324
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,520
it will not work for Android and hi
oscars

325
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,400
their are well by a French elsa bro I
just robbers

326
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,650
around open job function/ obviously and

327
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,410
it's quite complicated because I think
that it it's based on this

328
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,620
see types to for date for Android in
there as well

329
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,400
if it will be Don wants you may view
also use the pie of

330
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,510
jail for it but right now known give you
give you functions

331
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,410
official fight works just fine thank you
you're welcome

332
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,990
unico from

333
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,810
Ando question about the compatibility
everything to the

334
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,800
codes to if I were and answer is you
covered this already but

335
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,490
if I E route could to be used with T

336
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,550
intending to deploy it on injury with
certain

337
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,770
compatibility what I have if I also
wanted to deploy to

338
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,260
I O S disc if the serbs track

339
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,790
the code away from when it's running on
so I could compile

340
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,630
to you ATK and deploy that well

341
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,300

351
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,180
as I dot bikini on itself kearse about
it and it provides you

352
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,920
you know their our cross-platform
implementation of this function use

353
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,840
body fuel will you something more
specific

354
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,690
like your own library which is read an
onside

355
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,860
phone with use in some more
platform-specific called

356
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,810
well are it may not work it so we should
nation yeah

357
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:24,180
be careful about it but you can
generally just use the Python court your

358
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,100
pipe in court

359
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,230
with use in the queue libraries or some
other

360
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,610
libraries which is supported by the Q
project it's not the problem

361
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,330
are France well on both platforms

362
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:41,430
thank you yeah I think you do and

363
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,190
when I i've seen

364
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,490
code that I Britain I and I want to run
on Android

365
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:53,000
him but I don't want to do anything
related graphics supposedly present for

366
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,880
Android allows you to do such things

367
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,370
but I did not see any way to connect up
Java code

368
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,370
to to do that typical Angeles out by
four

369
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,660
do you know anything about that is that
something you from there with aus

370
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,820
sorry I'll the problem is that

371
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,680
running running that the Python code
from

372
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,770
from Java control code via icon for
Android is that

373
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,770
something you know about at all on

374
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,260
so running their Java quote from Python
or isomers

375
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,670
now without QB Montreal with south korea

376
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,400
are well it's possible but it's more
complicated

377
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,870
here's arm you need probably

378
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,050
really yeah botch their Java

379
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,280
runner on the Android cause eats

380
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,370
its I am it use more accused of well in
general

381
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,600
I am it just runs your

382
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,110
main dot by all file which may

383
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,100
not call some QB application and may
work like that process

384
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,920
with by from pot are anyway you need to
interact

385
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,060
somehow we their I with the display

386
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,280
yes so of for none graphical application

387
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,280
may be okay by the way still you need
access

388
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,530
there Android API for network and so on
and so on

389
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,040
and yes but I'll

390
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,570
for graphics on its creates their

391
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,580
as DL hot surface for you

392
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,030
and all other things is wrong here its

393
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,280
like like it's implemented for enjoy
something like this

394
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,910
yeah

395
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:39,400
okay nice see that no more information

396
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,610
great well yeah
