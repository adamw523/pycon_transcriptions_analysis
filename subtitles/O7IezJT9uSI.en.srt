1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,870
okay

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,490
jackets on who and the mikes on

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,390
only have net

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,730
Jackson here that lovely Jackson

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,730
on stage and he's going to talk to us
about she mining peaceful back

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,590
I run how ya doing

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,770
so my name I talk is enough machine
learning to make Hacker News readable

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,350
again

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,820
yes that's a little snarky I'm sorry on

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,739
so what I want to talk about sort uva
focuses I'm

11
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:48,690
Russian introduce myself to tonight and
plug in my partner

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,239
which

13
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,739
I it's just me oh by the way the slider
up on my website in jail but US

14
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,129
arm I'm the jail on the twitters things

15
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,200
I can email me and jail in jail that US
two I don't know ask me questions or

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,010
yell at me or whatever

17
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,070
so what I do here is a simple achievable
project something that is machine

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,290
learning related by think

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,259
all this RK per beloved which is a
personalized filter for Hacker News

20
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,759
taking Hacker News inserting articles
into what are called rack

21
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,189
and not track and then you read the not
track

22
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:27,290
and you feel much better about the world
in general

23
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,220
I'm so the whole point my talk is

24
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,659
I can machine learning and you can too
%uh machine learning

25
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:39,060
bike has this crazy name it. feels like
artificial intelligence like the machine

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,110
is learning man

27
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,650
and that's a lot of intimidation there
is a wanna science involved there's a

28
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,690
lot of terminology

29
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,880
you spent a lot of time googling you
spend a lot of time reading Wikipedia

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,540
articles and

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,640
survey over easy stuff but the essence a
machine learning

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,210
is actually start approach Engineering
Center pro tools you can use

33
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,310
I'm machine learning is just applying
statistics the big piles of data

34
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,680
that's really all it is so we gave this
wonderful name

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,119
when you get down to it your building
statistical models

36
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,970
a bunch input data and you're using it
to understand that they do better

37
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,030
or to make predictions are to better or
two sort of go further with the data

38
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,190
so yeah this terminology but we're gonna
I'm gonna give you a bunch of it and

39
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,440
then try to such a list

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,019
so here's sort of the workflow when you
doing machine learning you have to get

41
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:28,650
the data

42
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,629
which usually not as easy as you think
need to engineer the data

43
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,670
which means that need to take this Messi
real world stuff that you

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,740
scraped off the Weber got outta some
database in turn into nice on umpire

45
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,760
arrays with a well-written you know with
well-formed values

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,330
and then you need to train and two in
the model this is the science part that

47
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,560
training tuning the model

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,870
but in at other people but libraries you
can just use their libraries is great

49
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,580
and then applying the mall to new data
once again you just use libraries

50
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,120
you talk to folks who do this for a
living we have doctor to spend a lot of

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,220
time working machine learning

52
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,540
they spend all their time getting the
date in engineering the data

53
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,010
they burn a lot of CPU cycles but not a
lot of time training in tuning models

54
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,959
and then you know just applying it is is
very straightforward

55
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,760
so I'll be talking mostly about psych it
learn

56
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,280
on the documentation for psych it learn
is fantastic I

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,180
a couple pippin stalls away from having
a fully functioning awesome machine

58
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,129
learning library sitting on your machine

59
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:32,239
I heart spars install installing I'm and
song side pipe

60
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,650
so you've got a tutorial user guides API
docs in this flow chart

61
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,780
this flow chart is one of the coolest
things ever so

62
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,660
the hard part with machine learning is
there's too much terminology there are

63
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,260
too many things you can do you

64
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,680
there too many options there are people
say oh you support vector machines for

65
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,230
everything in the probably right

66
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,849
burden who knows like maybe you're
trying to something else so what this

67
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:56,540
does

68
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,840
this chart gives you some steps you can
go through to figure out what you wanna

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,849
start googling

70
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:05,590
alright it's a it's really head straight
for you say

71
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,739
II goodwill less than fifty samples ok
nevermind

72
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:11,330
right and so you can step your way
through this flow chart try to figure

73
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,900
out what you'd

74
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,360
pry into your data and you can start
figuring out what part to psych it

75
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,870
learned you need to research more

76
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,669
I would you need to find a couple papers
on on that what's good papers the coming

77
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:22,229
to be in overview the field without

78
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,090
bogging you down too much and we don't
understand the math go blah blah blah

79
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,840
keep reading

80
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,599
my my advice so something that we hear a
lot about a machine learning and I think

81
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,970
it's worth talking about bringing up in
just making people aware of

82
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,120
is concept to supervise versus
unsupervised

83
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,840
the supervised learning is when you have
input data

84
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,020
and then there's some output value so
for me

85
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,150
this was the input data was a buncha
stuff I scraped off a hacker news

86
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,860
insights that link to Hacker News

87
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,070
now as the input data and output was is
this crap or not

88
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,120
right so a bullion value true or false
threw something on a read

89
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,780
false something I wish didn't exist
right and so

90
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,949
thats classification that supervised
learning where you go and you have a

91
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,190
buncha labels in

92
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,229
output values and you try to turn input
data

93
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:15,300
into those labels are output values
thats supervised learning

94
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,590
unsupervised learning is more about
understanding your data that would be

95
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,340
I have mmm you know

96
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,430
thousands a packer news articles can I E
visualize them somehow

97
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,030
can I group them by subjects and I don't
know how many subjects there are but

98
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,500
Mike

99
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,740
fine subjects in Group them just kinda
unsupervised

100
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,400
sort of trying to understand the data
will be better are water power to it one

101
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,680
interesting bits there

102
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,740
I'm but I'm gonna set that a cyclist
talk in a pretty much we talk about

103
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,310
supervised learning

104
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,580
there are water really accessible books
on the topic I'm national language

105
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,370
processing with Python programming
collective intelligence the O'Reilly

106
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,120
books

107
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,160
aren't directly dealing with the topic
this hawk

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,190
but they do a really good job getting
you thinking about dealing with big

109
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,540
powers have text

110
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,680
as data which is a kind like a little
bit over thing to stretch your mind

111
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,759
to say you know what its tax but I can
turn into numbers and how do I go about

112
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,030
trying to numbers

113
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,380
the books from packed up buildings human
existence the papon in learning socket

114
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,889
learn

115
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,699
are both really good books that step you
through step by step but it ended kinda

116
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,020
walk you through a little bit contrived
example psalm and kimchi a

117
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,290
hide you from local to the real world so

118
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,490
not but as a side by the socket learn
thing and some patterns and stuff you

119
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,180
can see over and over again as you're
reading psych it learn code

120
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,930
and things look out for be aware of so
first things first they love them some

121
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,199
parallel arrays

122
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,669
I'm X is the input so in my case this is
an array of dictionaries

123
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,479
with lots of random junk from Hacker
News why

124
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,850
is the value you're trying to get out so
X is the input data

125
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,970
in my case why would be a bully and true
I wanna read it

126
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,860
false I don't first thing you want to do
with machine learning

127
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,720
and this is this is one of those hard
hard-won things that the

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,070
community is finally come to you is you
want to set aside

129
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,449
what's called the validation set you're
trying to train the computer to notice

130
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,530
patterns in to pick up on things on data
it has never seen before

131
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,919
right so it would be trivial to write
something which

132
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,000
saved all the input does it saw exactly

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,660
and then spit out the output values
again when it saw the same input values

134
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,009
it would look like it was perfect

135
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,500
it's a hit book I put it in a contrite
out Borchard curious about what you

136
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,440
wanna learn about

137
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,949
is new weird different interesting stuff
your machine hasn't seen it all

138
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,080
so what the idea validation said is is
you take about 25 percent your data

139
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,229
any serious I totally you know how to
touch it you know I'd like to look at it

140
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:41,780
at the very and you're done with
everything and use the validation set

141
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,990
to figure out if you did a good enough
job earn

142
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,000
for me I mark them on the database and
then when I was pulling in messing with

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,699
the data

144
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,090
my validation set didn't show up at all
and finally the end I is the

145
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,280
validation set to figure out how good my
results were

146
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,509
so how do you work what do you do you
you're gonna build pipelines

147
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:02,710
two sequences are things that operate on
data you're gonna optimize parameters

148
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,160
you're gonna be tweaking how these
things are operating on a date

149
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,289
pipeline just a sequence of operations
that's all it is

150
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,300
on they are this amazing wonderful thing
that allows you to

151
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,130
I'm put together a bunch of potentially
really complex steps

152
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,259
and then optimize this entire series a
complex steps

153
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:25,120
to get the best possible results so what
I have right here

154
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,410
universe and how it incurred up I'm just
importing the pipeline

155
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,539
I'm getting a this text package and a
linear support vector classifier

156
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,680
I'm so I create the pipeline I just give
each one of them a name

157
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,880
and basically this will take input blobs
have text in turn them into nice

158
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,569
numerical number I raise

159
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:48,519
in this will attempt to learn from that
input.text

160
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,730
missus you know very straightforward and
thats an almost complete

161
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,149
reasonable way first step to understand
some tax them to make some predictions

162
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:58,910
about text

163
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,839
really need but there's these things
called hyper parameters

164
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,420
so there are amazing amounts wonderful
Twi couple little

165
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,720
bits have math going on inside all these
these

166
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,850
gigantic statistical methods and

167
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,089
if you look you like oh there's this
thing called see Nick I wanna said to

168
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,009
some power

169
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:24,069
to when whatever you google that you
figured out you get some vague idea

170
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:25,600
what's going on

171
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,050
and then use these things called up well
they got a couple different kinds a

172
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,920
way to do this but the grid searches
amazing so you basically say

173
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,629
there are I don't know for different
values for see that seem reasonable

174
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:41,459
as two different guys for the loss
function I wanna try to different values

175
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:42,920
for the n-gram thing

176
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,850
and then the grid search I set the
number jobs -1 which means use

177
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,459
all my CPU's I put for both sequels to
which means print a lot of stuff the

178
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,610
output so that I feel like things are
happening

179
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,649
on and then I look at eight stop in all
of my all my CP is are pegged red

180
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:02,279
I'm the fans go on ages

181
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,439
crunches I actually had one that took
four hours cuz I was doing

182
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,579
multiple pipelines in parallel in just
testing all are trying to find the best

183
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:09,420
one

184
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,249
see just tryout all these possible
combinations in it finds out which one

185
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,480
is best at predicting your data for you

186
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,929
it does cross-validation always I think
for you behind the scenes

187
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:22,860
but you just try a buncha values it
tries all the values it right all the

188
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,239
combinations

189
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:27,279
and will spit out an object to the end

190
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,939
that is the most effective and efficient
and and accurate

191
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:34,379
I trained model very straightforward

192
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,470
that fit function is something you can
see a lot of

193
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,509
the three functions a particular
interesting I'm

194
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:44,199
transform unfit are both ones you might
have to write yourself and predict

195
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,980
is where be awesome statistics people
have done the magic for you

196
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,929
that's that's where the the sciences in
predicts and fits

197
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:56,899
so this is the transform are hashing the
treasury's we saw a little bit earlier

198
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:57,860
to turn

199
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,410
blobs have text into nice or raise

200
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,559
so all this one does though I through in
two parts by import this

201
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,809
and it turns it into a sparse matrix
floats with ten-story

202
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:13,959
elements are just takes this text is
read text and actually

203
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,199
for each column is a word not precisely
because enough each column is a word

204
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,239
each row

205
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:23,579
is a some input.text and we'll set those
values based on a simple text

206
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,589
really really handy way to turn text
into

207
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:30,350
something you can operate on it it was
numbers I'm the next step is

208
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,949
fit so this is this is where the magic
happens

209
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:37,399
I think that's that's the line so I'm
right here you say hey here's a bunch

210
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,160
input data and here's what the results
should be for that

211
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,699
right result should be that with the
output data should be is this why

212
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:49,439
it matches up the X&Y does a lot of math
and statistics

213
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:52,850
and it figures out what the value you
know it it figures out what it needs to

214
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,420
store internally or a bill to make
predictions in the future

215
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,579
predictions in the futures is predicting
you pass an array of things to make

216
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:00,420
predictions on

217
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,420
it spits out an array of gases

218
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,110
basically based report so

219
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,839
that's kinda it like that's that's the
real essence service there's

220
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,350
what server engineering though the real
world messy scary

221
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,679
I you gotta get the data right I'm how'd
you get the data

222
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,639
question Alexa now so I got a is
something that

223
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,850
scrapes the front two pages the Hacker
News every 45 minutes

224
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,339
personnel XML I pull out the links I
crawl the links if I haven't seen them

225
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,059
before

226
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:35,720
and I just basically go through and try
to grab all the data possible that I can

227
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,470
from

228
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,350
from Hacker News so I have this raw data
but what I need to know

229
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,720
is a need to know what's good and what's
not good I'm so I wrote myself a web app

230
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,199
I Mike the classified reckon on track
you can see the big red buttons for bad

231
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,769
the cacophony slide

232
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,989
on and so the course about six weeks I
think

233
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:59,069
I classified a five thousand articles
and found about 20 percent of them were

234
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,709
things I was going to read

235
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:04,239
I it was it was pretty epic for a while
there

236
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:09,619
I am I i came up with lotsa tricks to
make this faster so I controlled F

237
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:14,069
for quien I am or NSA

238
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:17,389
a or San Francisco or a bunch of other
things in

239
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:20,399
and just try to get rid of world news
and

240
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,499
business hacks and I'm stuff I salaried

241
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:27,290
and so i win and this is all my opinion
I'm so anyway I go through when I click

242
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,889
bad bad bad bad bad

243
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:33,600
on this bring the pain buttonwood show
me site after site an iframe with big

244
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,769
buttons at the top for good and bad

245
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,540
so there was a period there where I read
everything that made the front two pages

246
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,359
a packer news

247
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:43,639
almost I'm so yeah this was that

248
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,779
this was the hard part right this was
actually the hardest most involve part

249
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,730
entire thing was getting this data

250
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,249
that I could then feed into my models so
what they did I have had

251
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,639
the the title that was made with I had a
title for changed

252
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,009
I had the URL who similar it what was
there

253
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:03,149
arm how would smacks rank was how many
boats Academy comment

254
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:07,519
time a day and most importantly in most
painfully arrived at

255
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,869
whether I found to be directly or not so

256
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:15,049
we turn this message data into
normalized happy healthy fine

257
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:19,029
numb hi-res I'm there's a lot of
techniques for turning

258
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,269
words into numbers and I kinda wanna
give a

259
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,649
brief overview some items that you've
seen them once again you know what a

260
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:26,439
Google

261
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:31,169
up first up backwards so we have no the
phrase time flies like an arrow fruit

262
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,929
flies like bananas

263
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:37,029
arm and this is an incredibly
grammatically correct a grammatically

264
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,389
complicated in deep freights right like
flies

265
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:43,720
is a verb in one and its ones'

266
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,259
Island simply on at this is this is hard
for human being to fully parts right

267
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:52,029
I'm so forget grammar who needs it

268
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:55,499
we're gonna treat these words if they
were just a bag-of-words and say oh

269
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:57,910
flies like time in a row for bananas

270
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,709
good they're on their maybe some some
techniques account I'm summits bullying

271
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,319
you say whether the word is they're not

272
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,739
arm and also implicitly this doesn't
mention pat Quinn

273
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,879
I'm so pick 10 so we just can't
counterparts they're treated like

274
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,989
tobacco words

275
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:14,910
in just totally ignore this grammar
stuff grammer's hard

276
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,139
so if you wanna hinted the grammar
though there's this thing called n-grams

277
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:21,730
because talk about 10 grams immune grams
by grams and try grams and I don't know

278
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:21,989
what

279
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:25,779
would be quite grams are enough people
say four grams so so you just get

280
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:28,919
chunks words and you think these chunks
of words as if they were themselves

281
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,179
words

282
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,179
so instead of time flies being two words
you think it is

283
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:37,559
time flies you think a flies like and
you

284
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,339
look at just pairs of words are groups
of three or four however much input data

285
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,829
you have and how much memory you're
willing to burn

286
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:47,439
and he's kinda start building this
higher level understanding

287
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:51,929
love a bit that includes just that
little him to the grammar

288
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:56,329
does it is consequent normalization so
there's you sometimes hear stemming

289
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:57,549
limit is Asian

290
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:02,160
I'm and stemming is generally a hack
unlimited station is looking up in a

291
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,149
dictionary

292
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,399
I'm this is a really interesting thing
so there's this

293
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,939
thing called the snowball stammer and in
NLT K which is the national language

294
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:12,989
toolkit has lotsa fun things to play
with texting

295
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:16,559
and he grabbed a stammer and feed it
just

296
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,049
english-language taxed it tries to
normalize it so

297
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:23,759
does it really matter if you safe wiser
fly later flying

298
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,489
your anyone about other couple different
parts of speech it doesn't really matter

299
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,269
they're all kinda the same thing

300
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:32,220
so when he fly he like to fly up on
early flight searches

301
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,609
normalizes the words so that it kinda
hides a little bit have

302
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:40,389
10 scissor PLO roe versus singular he
does a great job

303
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,619
and finally there's this concept called
%uh stop words out

304
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:47,350
up final one its cuz I'll stop words in
the idea would stop words is

305
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,389
their words which are just useless they
don't give you any information about

306
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:52,689
what's actually going on

307
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:56,970
if you know that in our that a a article
the 20 from Hacker News

308
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,029
uses the word la but doesn't give you
any additional information

309
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:05,500
right who cares alright its it's just
its for the fluff that we use in normal

310
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,600
English grammar to glue stuff together

311
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,679
there's a set up stop words for English
that are included in Psych it learn

312
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,669
and I'm you can just send an option on a
bunch different things to

313
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:18,970
ignore stop words which can be you know
pretty pretty big boost

314
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,589
I'm this is this is the last thing here

315
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:26,900
term frequency inverse document
frequency so the idea is

316
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,549
if you have a word like bitcoins

317
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:35,070
in bitcoins shows up twelve times in
this article

318
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,090
wears on average it only shows up one in
every four articles

319
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,429
this article is clearly verily strongly
about pat Quinn has much more big point

320
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:44,960
in it

321
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,100
than any other article so let's give the
word

322
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,289
idk wine a little bit of a boost

323
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:56,259
and you let's give the word becoming a
little bit of a boost here

324
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:59,880
are told to kind have you know

325
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,850
get rid of it so other stuff here about
engineering features

326
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,940
so this is some some code I i've
actually used in my

327
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,620
my temps here so we can pull a relevant
tax

328
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,259
there's something called readability and
readability are

329
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,639
LX a male is a python re implementation
this browser plugin

330
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,190
tries to get rid of all the junk around
the outside a web page

331
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,159
so recommended links that you know a
menu at the top

332
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,419
ads also have other stuff that don't
directly relate to the main content to

333
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,190
the article

334
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,669
try to pull them all out with your
sticks and so with really believe that's

335
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:35,539
now

336
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,919
I take it I grab that summary

337
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,389
I parse the thing with LX email again I
try to pull out all the text and then I

338
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,389
returned the text

339
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,049
so I'm cleaning out all the HTML tags
and cleaning out everything I'm trying

340
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:48,389
to get

341
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:52,940
just two what is the relevant actual
real text

342
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,990
for this particular from for this
particular

343
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,990
each email page right

344
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,450
because a roll-your-own features so I
had a theory that I liked long-form

345
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,740
content

346
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,610
so what this does is our right here in
the transform function

347
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,880
it takes array of text and

348
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,230
just count how long each one is ever
turns their back as a nice two

349
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,610
dimensional array

350
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,740
and so you free texting you get back out

351
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,950
numbers between I don't know 0 and
probably tens of thousands

352
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,909
I'm all these things want the numbers to
be like centered on 0

353
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:32,100
and usually like standard deviation to
either side 12 -1

354
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,340
and the standard scale earthing which is
outta the box

355
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,970
takes these written random crazy link
numbers in centers than 10

356
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,679
and makes them a nice little even
distribution around zero

357
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,370
so I could any have this additional
feature that I created from scratch

358
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,279
where I kinda inferred something from
that source material

359
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,370
that wasn't immediately obvious in it
like

360
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,309
I'm you can also combine features with
this thing called feature Union

361
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,850
and basically what this does is this
takes art to

362
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,419
numb high res and kinda concatenate
someone sticks right next to each other

363
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,289
so that you can feed in multiple signals
am sticking together with this feature

364
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:11,070
Union

365
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,029
and you also notice I stuck this link
pipeline in as if it were

366
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:18,710
yet another thing so I I have like
pipeline since I pipelines as I

367
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,419
pipelines

368
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:23,330
I'm to sort of massage together
different features that then get exposed

369
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,399
all the way up

370
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:30,360
but my data starts his dictionary so i'm
just points out among the database

371
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,620
because I'm lazy

372
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,820
and this little thing here's a
transformer

373
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,419
that will poll values out over
dictionary and return those values

374
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:46,009
the way I use this as I get this idea
that maybe host names are relevant

375
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,909
right there are places that seem to pose
good content as places that post awful

376
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:50,710
content

377
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,850
and that should be a signal that might
should go into this machine learning

378
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,759
that right

379
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,289
so what I do is I arm use URL parse the

380
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:02,820
whole out the hostname for URL

381
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,070
and then I just returned that and then I
build a pipeline

382
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,909
once again about the pipeline so I feed
this in the raw manga results from my

383
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:13,250
database

384
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,500
extracts the URL from that and turns it

385
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,899
into an array of strings I then
extracted the hostname

386
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:26,360
from that URL and I pass it through this
defect arises thing

387
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,820
which then turns it into a nice
numerical number iraq which is pretty

388
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,870
much always the goal is to turn into
this nice little numb pirate

389
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,759
so what is the actual application look
like how you actually use the stuff to

390
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,529
do new protections you do this

391
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,720
I'm sorry Alex a anyway I'm

392
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,720
say savior save your input data so you
can recreate it later

393
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,649
I know if production systems which can
not be upgraded

394
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:53,759
on penalty of death because there's some
pickle from like

395
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,879
seven years ago that we can recreate and
like don't touch it

396
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:02,720
right so anyway keeper sample keepers or
status you can recreate it

397
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,149
but you just take that thing you pick
like mine is I think it's like

398
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:10,429
Jeezy up to the pickle at that the
predictions is like five mags and I've

399
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,629
got a chance will script that pulls it
down from s3 in frozen in the right

400
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:14,440
place

401
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,889
on the news passenger input data in the
same format that it got

402
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:22,649
the input data when your training it and
it magically works

403
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:25,840
I'm so I built this thing and

404
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,889
is a bunch different colors a mosam have
to do with what date I can grab

405
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:32,909
but read basically mean stuff it things
I shouldn't read

406
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:37,100
in green is stuff I think it should read
and I put up at each end up in jail that

407
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,350
US and I

408
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,730
like this morning when I hope I promise
to return cash in on for that

409
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,850
Soho pleated that right and if you have
all this data

410
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,980
right so you can build a staff to sort
stuff but he had anything to us both

411
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,759
things

412
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,789
so much unsupervised learning I'm can
you look at it

413
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,519
and figure out other other interesting
things I can do here or there other

414
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,990
is there tight cluster it like I said
can I find clusters

415
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,019
arm maybe could predict articles course
I

416
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:07,740
which would then be really interesting
combine with something that watching RSS

417
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,450
feed

418
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,909
and maybe are submitted I'm just saying
I am

419
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:15,370
and the real point I talked the thing i
really wanna stresses that machine

420
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:15,870
learning

421
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,549
is becoming engineering this is starting
to move out the Rangers

422
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:22,370
science where nobody really understands
what it does and you have to read a

423
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,460
million articles

424
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,480
and get a doctor in the stuff in to be
able to actually apply to the real world

425
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,960
there are libras out there that you can
use that you can start to understand the

426
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,419
properties up

427
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:35,690
you know twenty years ago if you want to
use a red-black tree pretty much had to

428
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,480
read it yourself

429
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,679
right and now we just accept that these
fancy things are in libraries and I

430
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,460
think machine learning is going the same
way

431
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,879
these are gonna be awesome statistical
techniques you need to know about

432
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:46,009
characteristics of

433
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:49,789
but they're gonna be libraries they are
in library thing you just go use 'em so

434
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:56,789
go use a min do interesting things I'm
thank you

435
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:08,559
she

436
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,999
thank you for talking to me a valid for
Q&A four minutes for Q&A

437
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:16,869
we have any questions we we don't have
the Mac power

438
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:23,869
a go-ahead II seige talk about smoking
area in

439
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,820
that when I was getting data that I look
at a search engine

440
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,999
are yet no that was

441
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:38,139
that was older that I i've I did this I
did this

442
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:41,960
I'm I think it is a couple months before
the new search engine

443
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,099
I'm yes I look at that I i you know

444
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:48,820
frankly I just need to grab to
essentially static web pages every five

445
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,269
minutes

446
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:53,080
arm I wasn't really interested in doing
in dept mining the data

447
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,320
there was enough scary danger in it
dangerousness

448
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,729
in crawling random URL's of a pattern is
applying them a database to keep me

449
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:00,259
occupied

450
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:03,700
your questions yes over there could

451
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,229
yeah if we could try to get line for the
mic is working now

452
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:11,599
yeah awesome I feel like I should just
had to shut your question running

453
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,080
airline

454
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,279
so

455
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:22,279
so he's whining about my accuracy with
the features I picked I found a fancy I

456
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:22,799
got

457
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,679
the worst my accuracy got I it's around
ninety percent accurate

458
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,299
and all the failures except for one I
cuz I i look to each one cuz I was going

459
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:31,570
on

460
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,429
so it's ninety percent accurate which
I'm proud of because anybody can get

461
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:35,129
eighty percent

462
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:38,609
are campus but it's not over that
accurate in all the failures are things

463
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:38,889
that

464
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:42,820
things I shouldn't read that a marked as
I would read

465
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,820
and I went back and looked at them and
they were usually things where

466
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,549
I said oh I would like to read the first
article about the NSA

467
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,019
I'm and then the rest to them I was like
new

468
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,309
are no I'm done now so a lot of my
failures were things I

469
00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:01,259
marked as readable and then change my
mind your questions

470
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:05,940
I get we do have a mic we should
probably be lining up for

471
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,940
right lap ride some way back there

472
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,320
yes so on

473
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,930
so basically you do something called
cross for validation where you

474
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,070
i holed out a portion of your data as if
it's you know

475
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,970
cross-validation in you train the other
80 percent and then you see how it's

476
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:32,310
good

477
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,000
is a particular 20 percent and so you
try bunch a different methods

478
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,030
and you try and i actually built this
thing that put like many pipelines in

479
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,850
parallel

480
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,660
and then optimized everyone in these
pipelines and then pick the best

481
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,710
pipeline and spit out what that was for
me and then retrieve the data so that my

482
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,730
pickle was only

483
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,900
25 megabytes rock instead of like 500
megabytes rock

484
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:58,210
so you can you can you just

485
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,530
try out all the options like this all
the switches and you just flipped all

486
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,260
the switches

487
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,820
and you have to keep your foot all the
switches for you and next thing you know

488
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,810
you know your laptop is very very hot
and you have something that can

489
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,660
predictive hacker news articles a
crapper not

490
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,400
amazing yes question so cute rain as you
use

491
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,180
your countries use it yeah I just this
whole thing about

492
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,950
you know feedback loops and I'm taking a
model and updating the model

493
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:29,020
on there's lots love complicated stuff
there that I'm happy to say is sorted

494
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,890
starts being out of my realm love real
understanding but I do have some stuff

495
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,160
in place where I go through every once
in a while

496
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,650
and I will flag a bunch articles as this
one is bad this one is good

497
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,950
and I will use the fact that it's
already been sorted for me too kindly

498
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,280
help me go through them faster

499
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,340
I'm there are techniques for like you
know

500
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,820
updating your model and stuff but
frankly I'm scared them

501
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:55,490
yes said the yep

502
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,300
would be the minimum number actually so

503
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,210
I did five thousand articles what would
be the minimum number of articles we'll

504
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,030
do this sort of thing

505
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,620
art that's a good question arm you know
if you look at the National flow chart

506
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,560
is owed you at least 50 things okay then
you can start doing stuff

507
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,560
but the real sort of weird thing that
the way this works is you want your

508
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,810
number samples

509
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,380
and see what kind of the number rose to
beam

510
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,560
to be much more then the number of
columns

511
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,480
I think we're done you want the number
for us both to be more than the number

512
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,350
of columns

513
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,929
and so if your gonna be feeding in text
which

514
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:33,790
by nature having all these different
words gonna have been many different

515
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,290
columns

516
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,560
you can you need to have a lot of
perot's right

517
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,750
so 5,000 may not be enough

518
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,000
but again who knows maybe 1000 work

519
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,700
and anybody else alright thank you very
much everyone really preach
