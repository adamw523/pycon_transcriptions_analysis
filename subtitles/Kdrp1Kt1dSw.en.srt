I welcome to my talk on making our
leasing and selling an anti-gay made in

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,300
Python

I'm very excited to be here I'm dodgy

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,240
of the major security leaks in the last
five years

you know hardly NSA all the Sony
PlayStation credit card leak

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,840
today I'm going to talk about

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,469
my game design aims I'm going to use pie
the day my engine to make a point and

12
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:41,440
click adventure game

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,219
very small angst a lot to get through
I'm going to about releasing a game in

14
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,140
publicizing it

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,260
I thought I'd start by introducing my
games am i

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,289
mainline is my ex-wife in space tyrant
and I'm working on a second one cause

17
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:54,430
came from pleasure planet

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,480
mice were gonna space tyrant as a
two-day point-and-click adventure

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,309
allelic a certain tell-tale inspirations
a day of the tentacle Space Quest and

20
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:04,080
Sam and Max

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,810
back to the future that's really the
science-fiction adventure

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,830
said inspirations were Star Trek The
Next Generation

23
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,320
Doctor Who and space 1999 and any of you
have seen that show in like it please

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,330
come in talking about it because I've
never met anybody else that has

25
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,549
you know he loves that show as much as I
did the screenshots by the way to give

26
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,799
you an idea of what it looks like

27
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,259
a big a famed and if you haven't figured
out by now

28
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,430
now's the time and inspirations
Priscilla Queen of the desert and

29
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,490
strained a culture and that's caused a
bit of coke bottle

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,530
sometimes overseas workers strand a
culture is quite camp in kitch

31
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:45,670
comparatively year and it was released
in December 2012 is digital download an

32
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,509
innate you play

33
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,210
as Captain Tai Chi Minh ok brought out
over time and to face invasion fleet

34
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,689
led by your ex boyfriend its non
pornographic

35
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:57,159
it's a serious attempt at a commercial
game and it's been paying the rent 7

36
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:57,680
very lucky

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,009
so that was the who where

38
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:05,549
what and when the why I made it is
because growing up there was a lack of

39
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,129
same-sex love interest in the science
fiction I loved

40
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,660
about the quests I got was in one other
foundation books

41
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,220
where I think I nation s where the main
character goes down to this: icy planet

42
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,260
ship gets impounded and to get it out
has to sleep with the minister of

43
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,840
security and she's a beautiful woman

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,870
but asimov is a pains to point out how
manly she is

45
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,030
and yes there wasn't much I had growing
up

46
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,019
so I picked a point and click adventure
game because a gay thing applies a gay

47
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,700
story and point-and-click gianna is
great for narrative

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,489
and its event-driven not time driven to
people played at their own pace

49
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,560
and I thought that would be a good idea
because my in my mind

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,620
the target audience were gay man who may
be once every five years players elder

51
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,629
our civilization

52
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,959
and I picked didn't Disney style
graphics up because

53
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,489
you know a lot of people are afraid of
computer games and they're afraid of gay

54
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,400
content and I thought by making at
non-threatening and fun

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,319
it would lend itself to comedy but it
also maximize its chance for success

56
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,830
up before we go any further and break
game sign down into its components

57
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,060
I'd like to say that I think in my
opinion game design

58
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,269
Croft and you want all the components
working together

59
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,659
all the time see what the artistic side
and the technical side and the business

60
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:15,209
side

61
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,290
always to be meshed together working all
the time see conscious to the art

62
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,140
and then come up with a game encounters
make a game and go how do I sell this

63
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,760
you know it every step of the process
you've got to ask is this artistic

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,110
is this technical but technically
competent you know can I sell this car

65
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,830
market

66
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,269
up so I'm gonna keep coming back to that
idea that it's

67
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,920
its whole process rather than just one
individual things will get up I think I

68
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,989
did a couple of minutes

69
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,409
but I just thought I'd point I disorder
mention that the actual card

70
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:46,810
is just a small part of the overall
process of making and selling a game so

71
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,480
what should

72
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,500
indie game developers aim for when
they're making a game I think

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,400
first whole day should aim to make
entertaining games now when I first made

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,189
the slide

75
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,700
I had fun bus as an indie developer

76
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,640
compared to you largest years you have
some advantages and see have some

77
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,530
disadvantages

78
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,769
out one advantage you have is that at a
conceptual stage

79
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,370
you get a be you get to think outside
the box and you know I really push the

80
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,080
boundaries it

81
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,299
so you need to make a fun game you know
your a

82
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:17,880
horror game doesn't need to be fun or
sad game doesn't need to be fun

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,370
but at some level they all need to be
entertaining so how do you make a game

84
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,320
entertaining

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,780
well we talk about gameplay and that
sometimes a nebulous concept

86
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,949
up but if you play or make games long
enough you sometimes can detect that

87
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,389
they had a bit of a beat

88
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,600
and they say has developed by your
charger that beat

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,530
not you games also have high points and
low points anti-one to maximize

90
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,320
the high points and minimize the low
points the number and the duration of

91
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,169
them

92
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:48,000
and you want to do it as soon as
possible cuz lady getting the process

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,710
the higher ed

94
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,479
and hard it is to remove that the dull
spots and I speak from personal

95
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,080
experience because in my ex-boyfriend
the space tyrant about half an hour into

96
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,290
the game there's a is really dead spot
we have to walk between

97
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,830
a castle in a field about three times
and every time I watch someone play the

98
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,630
game

99
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,410
they get to that point and its death to
it's too sterile I feel bad about it but

100
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,320
I'll

101
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,470
a so how can you make a game play
entertaining well a simple way is reward

102
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,110
for effort

103
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,550
safety kill swamp rats you get five gold
coins

104
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,110
but he kill the Queen at the spa brats
you give them five thousand gold coins

105
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,970
I made a cut saying thats a basic
example

106
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,330
if you wanna get even a living will take
about you can consider your game play in

107
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,820
terms of push and pull factors

108
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,110
so what's pushing a play through the
game and was pulling him through the

109
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,780
game

110
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,229
for example the push factor could be a
wall of fire that slowly advancing

111
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:37,410
through the level

112
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,330
an example a pull factor could be
something as simple as an open door in

113
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,110
the distance

114
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,680
because people always tend to like to
see what over the horizon

115
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,120
another way you can streamline game and
make it more entertaining is to focus on

116
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,919
making your controls an interface as
polished as possible

117
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,310
an example from Mikes way from the space
tyrant was that

118
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,580
there's an inventory system so and when
you clicked on its keeping in mind the

119
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,940
artistic side had this beautiful
animation

120
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,240
where the inventory swerved up and then
sweep down

121
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,330
and 12 testis came to mean goes it feels
like a bit of a drag to use the

122
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,960
inventory and I like it when there's an
inventory puzzle

123
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,539
entire place so that lovely animation
with just a simple pop pop pop down

124
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,240
and instantly the game felt snappier and
lighter and faster

125
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,460
and so you've just really got to kind of
in our focus on the game play to make an

126
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,819
insane game

127
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:26,259
something else I think game makers need
to focus on is quality

128
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,330
are you gay must be polished a

129
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,009
and how you achieve that well but free
and that's easier said than done

130
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,690
you wanna make a complete game say I
want half finished levels are dead ends

131
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,860
or anything like that

132
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,110
and you also wants the menu 3 polished
and that sounds like something that's

133
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,960
not so important

134
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,100
but it's really that kind of polished
that crossing the t's and dotting the

135
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,770
i's

136
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,919
that elevator game from an amateur game
to professional game and a professional

137
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,910
game is something that you can sell

138
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,490
and the other thing I think we need to
focus on as part of quality is making

139
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,699
the game good-looking

140
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,000
I know in the open source movement we
sometimes struggle with the estate

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,250
excite a software

142
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,300
bus you know if you make you can make a
great game but it doesn't look good no

143
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,479
one not very few people wanna players

144
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:10,110
a so don't bother coming to the party if
you're not prepared to put in the

145
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,699
resources to make your game

146
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,740
good-looking and I think finally

147
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,830
what game developer should focus on when
they make the game

148
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,870
is making an interesting game and it
must be interesting to other people

149
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,300
and that ties into the marketing
published decided making a game

150
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,229
and we often think of those as dirty
words but they really just tools for

151
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:32,280
putting the game in front of people who
find it interesting

152
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,759
and dietary process when you put in
front of people who have no interest at

153
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,370
all because enya scamming another time

154
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,880
at one thing to consider when making
interesting game is there's a difference

155
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,729
between making something people want

156
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:49,060
versus what they will want and Kathryn
Kennedy I'll come out the canadian

157
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,389
example

158
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:54,990
a lot of people want zombie games so if
you're Canadian developer maybe you make

159
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,210
Canadians on the game and

160
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,750
bring us two games are fun to the
Canadian game at they may gravitate

161
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,280
towards the Canadians on the game
instead the generics on the game

162
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,740
a whether that and that's because you
may something they will want

163
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,780
not necessary something they want but
whether that is profitable for you is

164
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,500
the business decision you have to make

165
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,190
so Klein adultery test to my game is
entertaining

166
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,639
well I mention the dead spot about half
an hour and that'll an experience for me

167
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,789
the point n click genre is a mixed bag
has a reputation for being a bit slow

168
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:27,889
and you've just got up kinda mitigate
that sometimes I

169
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:31,770
work to that by making a comedy if you
can afford explosions and things like

170
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,750
that put in a joke people often
remembered just as much

171
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,529
there's a tip system to help you when
you get stock you can't get help from

172
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:40,200
the system and I'll tell you where to go

173
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,219
that's really important in a
point-and-click hi it can be frustrating

174
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,730
and FPS

175
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,779
to have your %ah spawn location camp by
sniper but that's nothing compared to

176
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,930
the frustration have

177
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,230
not being able to put the fish in the
bucket which so often in point and click

178
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,200
adventure games

179
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,279
yes a is a quality well I thought I was
a complete package with a few rough

180
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,170
edges

181
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,310
and is an interesting well it has been
quite compelling fit for gay men the

182
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,440
target audience and it was quite
compelling for the press

183
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,230
have two sides coming up on that so it
let's make a game

184
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,290
using my engine al Qaeda too small on to
the first step is to

185
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,279
rights your own adventure in this
example will to see that really can't I

186
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,450
go into the foyer

187
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,839
as a guard at the door there's a steady
drip from a small crack in a dime

188
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,720
you i'd in the crack because the flood
the God leaves his post up at the crack

189
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,769
so the doors on got it then you go
inside and destroy them sing

190
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,380
so already should be asking yourself is
entertaining is this quality is an

191
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,690
interesting can I sell it to you

192
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,850
baking at every level but for the
purposes today affecting

193
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,959
so my engine the basics if I V to is
simplicity

194
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,480
to use it constant feedback to the
designer so they know what's happening

195
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:44,940
and

196
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,709
unit runs like a tank because it's going
on all its computers an adventure games

197
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,529
can really be made using bait six basic
sort of

198
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,279
fun interactions like looking at
something interacting something using

199
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,589
an item on another item saying things
going places

200
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:02,779
and doing things with by Vita I really
tried to bring a stage play mentality

201
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,320
it's the process always think I've

202
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,589
inner hothouse directors with a ever
make a computer game version of the art

203
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:09,279
house film

204
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,170
and so they go into the room with the
developers in the developers would say

205
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,930
well the first thing you need to do

206
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,890
is load up your background resource know
those people would just turn around and

207
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,170
walk out of the room

208
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,540
but if you're strapped up into the sort
of stage by idea

209
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,820
conceptually it's a lot easier to deal
with and you know we

210
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,390
getting I and when you go to a stage
play

211
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,029
mentality it lapse overlaps very well
for two tester in mentality

212
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,660
you think ever play as something that's
written first and then you acted

213
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,450
where is a test driven you write the
test specimen you feel on the card

214
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,450
in fact and private or cards that so
much so that

215
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,750
a space tyrant was written using tester
and development

216
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,320
sir let's look at some examples

217
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,450
at this is you can people read their
phone to write

218
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,839
the night that's less good alright so

219
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,339
we can see here the simplest game is
just a black screen doesn't do anything

220
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,120
so we'll move on to more elaborate
example at you import your

221
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,430
your classes the heavy in track scripts
sir you click on the lake it says hello

222
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,329
world it's late to become a god goes
hold his go there

223
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:15,620
because they're then we have out some
scaffolding where we build us a net

224
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,740
assets a week

225
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,980
traders say no the background week right
after we first

226
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,490
idle action you know we do the same for
the leak into the main player

227
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,750
Demi add them to the same set the camera
and we got

228
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,240
I look at the code I roll my eyes a bit
that will give it a go

229
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,529
right so you can see here that's it
slowed up are saying

230
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,519
and at Actis to the sane including a
lake and 58 is done

231
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,089
a bit of magic already works detected
that the lake was an animation insert

232
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:46,029
animating force but there's nothing much
you can do because

233
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,079
you know we can really say we didn't
like it. much

234
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,880
sir let sector the next step if you're
willing to use

235
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,350
the smart layout that Piper private aka
news

236
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,579
you know you act as a directory fonts
and everything in our directory to

237
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:02,060
replace all the scaffolding

238
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,430
with a smile attraction so you have to
use it but I highly recommend

239
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,070
so we check out amoral our script well
at some ways

240
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,089
would expand at a lake script so that
when you click on a lake

241
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:17,180
it will crack it'll get bigger the
gobble spot at

242
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,200
walk over there and in the game state
changes so they can move around

243
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,339
on all that scaffolding been replaced by
this one call to smile I'd

244
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,889
and we've added a little extra button:
to the menu to stick it make it a little

245
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,899
bit nice on exiting

246
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,709
sorry run at and see what happens

247
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,750
where you get a loading screen for
example but here we have

248
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,019
now skirt once again click on Lake
cracks

249
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,040
gets bigger got spots at

250
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,870
he walks AR plugs at and now

251
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,089
you're free to walk around

252
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,649
bit of this rank as the revelation and
because there are multiple actions for

253
00:12:58,649 --> 00:12:59,060
the

254
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,410
the that act out their path planning
algorithm kicks in and you can play

255
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,220
around

256
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,550
and keeping in mind the constant
feedback thing other show you a little

257
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,410
feature of the engine is there's an in
game it up

258
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,100
said designers can just make the changes
and instantly see

259
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,870
what's happening telex that so that's

260
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,320
a basic game adventure game made a party
to now mission daily at that is test

261
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,490
driven development

262
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,339
and that's a very useful feature
especially with a point click adventure

263
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:27,880
game

264
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,779
which is very narrative based so we go
back to that script we looked at

265
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:36,110
that we just ran and scroll down to the
bottom out description of the game that

266
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,930
we very rarely I

267
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,510
has been broken down into a series of
steps in a start in the foyer

268
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,600
started the fire you track to the lake
center and

269
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,000
eccentric cetera and we sing the courage
that but as a second-half to the game

270
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,420
that there is a code for where you go in
Thai side the dime

271
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,510
destroy them saying and that's missing

272
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,250
so when you do run the test run a the
game runs perfectly in till

273
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,570
it confines the second sane and its
tasks are areas and that's when you can

274
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,800
tell the game us guard rails

275
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,350
so it's quite useful never got but

276
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,100
its are useful for that once you've
embedded that

277
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,630
walks her into the card you do get
access to a lot of other things not just

278
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,720
test you can also generates

279
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,329
a human-readable walk sorry from the
game automatically

280
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,649
which is very useful for point click
adventure game tonight a feature

281
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:31,560
is also useful to help system you can
track where someone is in the game by if

282
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,199
have tripped

283
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:35,680
the next step in the walk sorry but

284
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,100
there is one mea culpa with this that
happen to me why I was based aren't on

285
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,050
its cover just before release

286
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,110
is that when those tests or completes
you can guarantee that someone can play

287
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,920
the game from start to finish

288
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,130
if and only if they play it perfectly if
at any point they deviate from the

289
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,519
walkthrough

290
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,579
a that's when you can get a raise and
that's actually turned out to be the

291
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:57,910
source of much problems

292
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,430
to the preferred by Vita water is you
write a game-breaking step-by-step to

293
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,839
stir

294
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,699
directions build the set snack to say hi
routes or something like that

295
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:09,750
and then I need and you actually fill
out the game scripts

296
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,850
something else I think is a sign a
quality nazar

297
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,000
overlook game design is accessibility I

298
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,910
other place that people don't have
accessibility issues software has

299
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,370
accessibility issues

300
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,440
is a really great website called the
game Accessibility Guidelines

301
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,320
has about three dozen suggestions on how
you can make a game more accessible

302
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,110
simple things like making sure there are
subtitles all the way up to

303
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,420
making sure you can skip the cognitively
challenging puzzles

304
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,329
I've had a background in web design
e-commerce and I think a lot of

305
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:40,740
suggestions we actually also apply to a
website

306
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,880
something else i think is a sign of
quality and is very underutilized the

307
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,079
nominees including the sauce with your
game

308
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,339
on its a selling point with a segment of
the community it assists with

309
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,399
accessibility because people can
customize the experience there are needs

310
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,480
it make gives the game a longer life as
it can be ported to platforms that don't

311
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,660
exist yet

312
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,610
uses continue bug fixes which is always
lovely and also to myself open

313
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,040
ecosystem that we all you know I really
love and support

314
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,560
as its good points just reiterate that
the game code is only a small part

315
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,100
but the overall process of making and
selling again

316
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,579
cuts out the tools I use for making
gains I use Google Drive

317
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:22,019
Google drive whatever it's called outlet
to the design space art was made using

318
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,139
Python 2.7 pie game my next game

319
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:30,470
is using Python 3.4 and maybe piglet I'm
expanding at the moment

320
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,149
I I've been trying to write Python 3
compatible card for couple view service

321
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:35,870
which has been quite easy

322
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,880
you guys really genius when they first
announced by from three because they had

323
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,459
brackets

324
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:44,259
to bike converted prints from a
statement to have met a function and

325
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:47,190
what attracted me to tighten in the
first place is how simple Prince hello

326
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,149
world was

327
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:51,320
and I feel like a loser great retrograde
step but having used it for

328
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,480
exclusively for three to six months now
there's Israel al against by from three

329
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,110
so you have made the switch yet

330
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,209
his another vote for me free to do so
eyes get help

331
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:04,189
soco deposit review not using american
depositary the peace of mind brings is

332
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,240
amazing

333
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,789
project management a stellar to calm
which is a web service

334
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:12,120
where you have cots Petoskey not much
better than email

335
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,750
but most importantly you have Irish for
tasks which is very important when

336
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,439
you're planning a large project

337
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,110
the game scripts which is a small pot
packaging have a slide on that

338
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,910
for the website I is a something like
Amazon Web Services is quite good

339
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,760
and further online sales I use a service
could be Antimicrob

340
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,770
them so packaging on Python a binary for
sale

341
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,530
you know I think by design that made it
difficult for their highways around it

342
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,970
on Windows he can use game to exceed up
I to compile it and I set bundle it up

343
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,530
pie to ap are and create mg on Mac to
crater

344
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,650
distributed disc image and on lanix I
have a source archives and a little

345
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,980
install scripts that installs the
dependencies

346
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,780
like pie and that system-wide a debate
whether it was okay to install thing

347
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,520
system on someone system but

348
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,980
a the steam Linux client does the same
thing and I thought itself can get away

349
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,590
if thats

350
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,490
I our getaway the turkey so go down to
one can fix Krypton 3

351
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,340
build scripts so it's alright talk right

352
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,000
something that you really should
consider when you're making a game is

353
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,340
having some method for updating it or at
least

354
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,870
letting people know it as an update you
never launched 110 perfectly so

355
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,990
make sure you know I you've got some
method for letting people nine

356
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,190
%uh your website in a trailer is so
important to our people leave it to the

357
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,250
end but from day one you should be
planning a trial and maybe even your

358
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:31,919
website

359
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,809
%ah you know at least initially your
trailer will sell more copies of your

360
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:36,970
game any game will

361
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,039
sorry really deserves a lot of time and
effort

362
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,500
and ask the same questions you ask if
you gain your is this entertaining is

363
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,210
this quality

364
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,840
is it interesting you're treated like
the first part of your game

365
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,990
se ve made a fun game maker fun website
if you made a horror

366
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,350
game make our website you wanna sell
your aim at their

367
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,429
lots of ways to do it in PC world you
are sold direct

368
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,789
there's BMT my current humble store I
use BNT my car

369
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:04,919
no problem sir it's pretty good and
thing is switching to how most or mostly

370
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,799
because the sale widgets

371
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,010
is on the same page as as the game and
where's BNT micro takes you to a special

372
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:11,780
page

373
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,549
and I feel that that may affect
conversion rates and you won every sale

374
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:15,120
you can get

375
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,530
some they can do his team up with other
indie developers and

376
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,360
come up with a bundle where you put your
six games together and

377
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,650
then people pay what they want to sounds
big cat counter-intuitive but is being

378
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,679
quite profitable for people involved

379
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,130
they're also at stores for PC games
three main ones a desire a good road

380
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,660
games and steam but I

381
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,919
of the 3i anyone really matters and
that's tame a

382
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,510
about 90 percent people sales come out
the same so should focus on getting on

383
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,549
that really

384
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:44,890
and something else turned out in two
games is that they have a long tail so

385
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,789
when we think a blockbuster games and
blockbuster films

386
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,880
they often if they fail on the first day
that I make money on the first weekend

387
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,679
people say the failed

388
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,970
but with any games it takes a while from
a typical a through the internet

389
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,320
and in case it might work in space
tyrant he really took six months for

390
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,539
sales to start to pick up

391
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:05,409
and have been quite consistent sense
something that happens

392
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:08,610
when you finally released a game is a
thing called the death the of where you

393
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,640
have no control over how people actually
receive a game

394
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,500
and you can try our hardest to make an
entertaining game but if someone's head

395
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,730
a bad mood you know bad morning or you
know their parents were killed by clowns

396
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,640
when I sit down trivia clown game del
give it a bad review

397
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,159
a but you just gotta kinda blanche role
that Atletico because it's nothing

398
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,590
personal

399
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,929
things that you should be ready for
feedback from users and how you gonna

400
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,320
deal that journalists

401
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,900
review copies always have some on hand
and also try and get ready copies at

402
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,250
reviewers at least two weeks before you
launch

403
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,360
because a lot of viewers like to have
their review up on day one

404
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,309
so it's fresh for everyone involved
because you get reviews

405
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:51,990
quite the good ones and land from the
bad ones in all the really really bad

406
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,770
ones

407
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,409
a hero swagga something I like to do you
just send a copy of the game someone

408
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:58,080
that's inspired you are more often than
not

409
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,590
essential to thank you night and then
you got a little connection to someone

410
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,570
you like

411
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,150
not something I'd never heard of until I
lost a game

412
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,100
is this this the sort of John Irving
entertainments Coldplay there so let's

413
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,669
play

414
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,850
where people play the game online on
YouTube but which

415
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:18,110
for their followers to watch and II
gotta be blindsided lies on my way to

416
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,360
convention last year

417
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,720
and decide hopping on the plane I got a
little media let from Google

418
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,490
that some fella but uploaded a place
throughout the game

419
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,159
and by the time I got off the plane an
hour and a half later forty thousand

420
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,350
people have viewed it

421
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,669
and watching its it was it

422
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,460
did my head in a bit because he was
playing it as an authority because he

423
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,620
knew he was straight and he was an
interesting day games but its repeated

424
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,799
interest a bit

425
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,880
answer she was in playing its how I
envisioned it being played

426
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,179
but United there is a right way to play
a game

427
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,500
and it's not nice to give players a
community politics is something you

428
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,260
gotta be careful of I am

429
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,270
I put space tyrant up on Steam
greenlight

430
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,960
sustain green light is this process
where everyone on Steam get a yes or no

431
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,870
vote

432
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,860
asserts an ultimatum are 60 a game like
space tyrant which is

433
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,730
in a targeted for pipes and population
it was never going to fare well

434
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,110
but the economics of it a tu la should
not because we get on Steam it's very

435
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,360
very good thing

436
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,659
but one thing's life-size ready for it
to be sort on down

437
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:20,179
but what did surprise me was that when
you

438
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:24,990
insert a game into an ongoing community
it becomes a proxy for conversations

439
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,179
they've been having for a long time so
one thinks the steam greenlight people

440
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:29,270
always talk about is what

441
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,100
make steam different to other gaming web
sites and the usual game as a proxy for

442
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,440
that

443
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,559
that I mean anything by it read it as
well %uh just now be careful as to get

444
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:37,809
away

445
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,130
request from head attention to media is
something

446
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,990
used should focus on like the Indy game
Press is very very crowded

447
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,250
there's hundreds against race day I
think that's fair to say that

448
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,750
but there's a lot of other press but is
very few games come along so I was very

449
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,850
lucky in that I had the gay press

450
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,450
to pick up on a gay game cuz it's not
many of them and then once it gets into

451
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,940
the search and gentle media's excess
ability me is a great one too

452
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,030
once it's out there a kind of goes
sideways into the gaming press

453
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,110
so that's a really great way to get
coverage and once you start getting

454
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,770
coverage

455
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,630
you get their party advocacy and if you
can get other people who don't know

456
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,070
talking about your game

457
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,190
that really really make should life a
lot easier

458
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,960
see all get feedback he is you know a
lot of feedback I got

459
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,559
I'd don't know how much time I got left
but may be the last ones just indicative

460
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,130
of the whole thing really

461
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,390
I sware dis is made up it's cherry trees
to be made up but I like it and I

462
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,970
is a whole lotta fun as a gay guy does
the game i won his play all my life

463
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:39,140
thank you brian of course you get
negative feedback

464
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:46,140
well I got negative feedback

465
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:56,580
fan of the spelling Obama but it is what
it is

466
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,180
and united just after awhile it just
becomes noise in a way

467
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,220
a so with the press its

468
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,600
importantly he came into use 7 beds some
stories in it for the press to pick up

469
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,470
on so I

470
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,490
made sure I had you know a gay story to
tell

471
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,490
to the gay press and a strain story to
tell to the

472
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,680
to restrain Press and gaming story to
tell the gaming press even on you know

473
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,810
gaming press probably

474
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,490
work gonna be a hard sell %ah and that
worked out quite well but one thing I

475
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,160
did learn about dealing with the press
special the gaming press

476
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,990
is this are rare is that I only game is
interested in games

477
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,380
to getting non-gay miss to talk about
your game is very very hot

478
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,600
and I miscalculated a bit in at my

479
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,870
when I made the game I made it to people
who don't really play games very often

480
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:45,410
it turns out they really play games very
often at the people to play games

481
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,130
a game it's so if you're going to make a
game make it for

482
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,860
game it's Anna yes something else I like
the hard way

483
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,190
eyes that Jowell

484
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,670
potential price point very important %ah
you know

485
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:06,420
don't undersell you work but when you're
planning your work unite do the size

486
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,620
put in effort to let you know a price
point and I S

487
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,020
the loss thing that I i Lance the hard
way

488
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,400
was the great ideas become guys come
pouring ideas games

489
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,160
are a marathon not a snot sprints answer
something that seems like a great

490
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,980
moments

491
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:26,420
you have a libel moment on you can be
with that idea for her eighteen months

492
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,170
to years

493
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,910
so you really wanna battle tested early
on Anna T

494
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,470
has seven well I'm making another game

nines Salisbury

507
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,940
very lucky in fact probably on the
greatest days of my life is when he said

animation a cause he's campaigning scape

512
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:53,600

515
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,270
3 next time already have plans

516
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,230
make the make the bank because

517
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,640

I'm switching everything got

520
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,430
which is another graphics library book

521
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,970
I mean by to accept that all right right
right

522
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,630
yeah hopefully we'll put it there we're
looking into that

523
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:39,600
okay yeah thanks there

524
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,960
on and this is traditional business plan
you have for this game

525
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,030
that is you sell it on Steam or his
ideas

526
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:52,280
you talk about free to play or other
micro micro

527
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,380
payment system well United

528
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,810
I did have a thing about the price
points Tom basically I I looked at it

529
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:04,120
as a project that is like a gay film or
a gay novels so it's a boutique product

530
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,220
for boutique audience and initially

531
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,210
I never thought that its competitors
while the computer games I thought its

532
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:10,910
competitors

533
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,140
where no box sets having a clear as far
call

534
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,120
and Amistad more open book and so that
was really the mentality of it

535
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,170
service I like free play and name

536
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:25,610
like a cheaper version on the iPhone or
Android I'm not particularly interested

537
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,750
in going up because it's such a small

538
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,630
markets so you've got a kind of I really
want to try and keep the price went up a

539
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,110
little bit

540
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:38,170
you thanks for the talk it's great but I
finally got to see

541
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:42,150

542
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:46,130
kind of unique contacted directly do you
have any advice

543
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,700

go about finding posts
