1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,169
good morning everyone and to make sure
the slider

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,359
area perfect okay so this is not about
Python

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,050
the next teaching the next generation a
Python programmers and

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,190
on this to talk that uses a lot of data
from the United States because that's

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,550
where I live in where I went to school
or I have the best and personal

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,630
experience but I think a lot have are
the lessons and opportunities to

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,980
collaborate based on

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,320
I we talk about and transcend national
boundaries

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,780
I'm are you really does start I am
particular state in the United States

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,180
though

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,770
%uh this is Tennessee tennessee is
famous for a lot of things are most

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,510
notably

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,570
country music and Jack Daniels I

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,530
but it is also the place where I went to
high school and where my family now

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,170
lives

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,850
their 285,000 high school students in
Tennessee

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,150
I and how many than you think are taking

18
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,800
Advanced Placement computer science
which is on the most common

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,040
our computer science class a high school
students in the US can take

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,590
I'm international law exam now to 35,000
students

21
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,920
how are we doing so

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,960
reaction have an exact number the number
is 251

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,549
so Western .1 percent have a high school
students are taking

24
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:23,720
the most common our computer science
exam so with that framework and my name

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,479
is Jessica I'm a director for the
Pythons after foundation

26
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,330
I'm I spend a lot of time I and energy
and money thinking about this problem in

27
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:31,990
particular

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,909
how the Python community can be apart
addressing this

29
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,070
lack of engagement so bad as well we'll
talk about

30
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,720
today of your statistics for you

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,900
first are in the United States there's a
lot of enthusiasm for students learning

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,860
how to code

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,869
a lot I really important and famous and
rich people

34
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:57,439
even the President of the United States
believe very strongly that I'm all

35
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,409
students should have

36
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,439
at least the opportunity to learn how to
program in school

37
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,439
unfortunately reality is lagging
significantly behind the enthusiasm

38
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,450
and so this is a graph I have and
participation in all over the Advanced

39
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,129
Placement

40
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,370
exams all these national I am exams on
friday is subject to the top we have

41
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,980
English Language and Composition

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,900
arm and source skimming down the west we
see that I'm narrowly beating out

43
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,019
2d studio art is computer science

44
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:33,680
I about an order of magnitude behind the
most popular classes

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,620
and this black and Asian actually hit
home for me very person likes I actually

46
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,599
have a sister

47
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:46,709
in bolivia who is in high school right
now and she is a perfect candidate for

48
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,749
this type of Clash she loves electronics
this is a picture her soldering

49
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:56,519
a radio kit I she loves math but in her
high school she goes to a public high

50
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,159
school in Nashville Tennessee

51
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,709
on the closest class that she can take
to a computer in class

52
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,919
I is a casa teachers how to use
Microsoft Word I'm

53
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,389
and her experience is actually the
typical one now because of the way that

54
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:12,519
education works in the US

55
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,769
its decentralized throughout the state
we don't actually have good data

56
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,859
on engagement in non AP Computer Science
classes were using AP as the benchmark

57
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,949
in there is one that is most common

58
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:26,779
I we know many schools teach apcs and we
know how many public high schools there

59
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:27,150
are

60
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,739
so we can %ah per pound you know how
likely you are to be able to take a

61
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,169
computer science class in school

62
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,579
the answer is that most students simply
don't have any opportunity

63
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:40,180
so this is a

64
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,249
are kinda bomber are but actually gets a
lot more troubling than that

65
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:47,319
okay sir in Tennessee last year

66
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,749
251 students took the exam the CS exam

67
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:55,139
and 165 past offer pass rate of
sixty-six percent which is actually

68
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:01,900
at pretty normal for TP exam at the pass
rate for african-american students was

69
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,680
less than half

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,639
that and actually their entire states

71
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,760
in the United States were no
african-american students take the exam

72
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,309
at all

73
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:15,650
their state's 10 Hispanic students have
taken the exam

74
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,780
and despite being fifty percent of the
population there

75
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,600
even states were no girls took the exam

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,050
and you ever gonna look at these matters
should be honest about the statistics

77
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,380
I'm it may or may not be statistically
significant in so many states

78
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,950
on you're out there may just not be that
many african-american high school

79
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,660
students in montana

80
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,340
you know that that may be true but I
think this is no

81
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,980
real comfort to the students who
represent these demographics

82
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,190
if I were a girl in mississippi and I
were thinking about taking a computing

83
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,420
class

84
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,680
are and I knew that if I took apcs

85
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,540
I might be the only girl in the state to
do it

86
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,780
that does not make me feel like this is
something that people like me deal

87
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,020
but they were supposed to do. and I damn
well better pass the exam otherwise I'm

88
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,930
gonna be a statistic that people talk
about

89
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,000
I we have gender data for all %uh VP
classes I

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,530
and a really interesting way I'm looking
at this data is to plot a log

91
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,480
the ratio I'm so here is that plot I'm
so

92
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,510
I for for all the classes and issues
right that means there are more girls

93
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,270
and boys taking the exam

94
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,950
its use laughing these are more boys
than girls

95
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,670
and this crap is is really interesting
for for a lot of reasons I mean actually

96
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,310
if you look at this and there are more

97
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,510
AP classes in which girls outnumber boys
right we see at the top

98
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,060
but as soon as we start looking at math
and science classes it starts going the

99
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,340
other way

100
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,710
and in fact computer science is the most
gender skewed

101
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,990
class

102
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,120
and this matters to us this matters to
us because we spend an inordinate amount

103
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,350
of time

104
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,870
and energy and money and blood and sweat

105
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,470
and actual tears I'm doing some modus

106
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,580
any quality representation that starts
in high school

107
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,750
and an earlier so this absolutely
matters to us

108
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,430
does blow leaky pipeline matters to us
but it actually matters to me for a lot

109
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,500
more reasons I suspect it matters to you
from a reasons as well

110
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,550
no one reason I want students to at
least have the opportunity to learn how

111
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,000
to program to engage in computational
thinking skills

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,670
is because I understand how impact our
ring programming is

113
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,070
like learning how to program changes the
way that you think about and interact

114
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,490
with the world

115
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,130
I want more people have that experience
I want our politicians worm

116
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,300
making decisions about the way that my
country is run

117
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,720
actor to have that experience

118
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,130
and also as Python he says %uh this is
important to us for the long term

119
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,470
success the language

120
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,960
it's important to us that people are
learning how to program preferably in

121
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,420
paper I'm

122
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,940
okay well this has been sort of a
depressing in traction and it seems like

123
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,300
it

124
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,360
impossibly huge intractable problem

125
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:15,010
so what can you and I am actually doing
a space

126
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,900
well we can actually take art in so many
statistics okay so

127
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,320
AP Computer Science Camino state is the
most gender skewed

128
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,180
Advanced Placement exam by its

129
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,700
in Tennessee my home state

130
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,240
almost a third of the test takers are
actually girls

131
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,389
I and this is the highest percentage of
any state United States last year

132
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,680
can guess why this is the guest

133
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,820
it

134
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,220
the reason is one person as one teacher
her name is Joe

135
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,139
and she teaches computer science an all
girls Preparatory School

136
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:59,570
school in chattanooga tennessee sheet
almost half

137
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:06,570
RB apcs test takers who are girls last
year

138
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:15,069
and what this really means is that one

139
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:18,430
motivated teacher can set a national
record

140
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,069
and this is one person and i'm looking
out across the room and thinking about

141
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,779
the people who watch this video

142
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:28,069
and I ask an honest an earnest question
which is what

143
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:31,529
what can a 200,000 per cent community

144
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:35,860
like ours that spans the globe do if
we're serious about this

145
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,860
we want to do something about this well

146
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,410
I asked I'm about you people I I asked
my job

147
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,839
CS education researchers I how to answer
this question I

148
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,070
arms with a giant pile on community out
what are some things that we can do to

149
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,970
make a difference

150
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,399
I was going to be the fire hose
responses

151
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,130
I'm I'm gonna give you everything and
not all these ideas have to resonate

152
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,380
with you but I hope that at least one
guy's

153
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,940
let you leave here with something that
you believe that you could be a

154
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,089
are going to talk in for a big area some
policy

155
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:14,890
student engagement supporting teachers
and curriculum

156
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,180
developments and for such as policy

157
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:26,180
gears map in the states that counts a
computer science for something

158
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,120
to graduate high school and even if you
don't live in the US

159
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,040
I if you're probably in in a similar
situation

160
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,769
on there is a problem that computer
scientist typically only an elective

161
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,790
and this is a problem because it does
not

162
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,930
align incentives for the people involved

163
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,220
if you're an enterprise a high school
student you are already way too busy

164
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,630
trying to graduate and can I resume

165
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,630
you can hopefully get a scholarship to
afford college

166
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,630
I'm and you're not gonna waste time on
some elective on some topic that you

167
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,570
don't know anything about

168
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,620
and assume so I take it schools don't
offer and teachers definitely don't want

169
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:04,910
it

170
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,220
invest their career and training in some
class that will have dubious

171
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,399
attendance so here's a very concrete
thing that each of us in this room could

172
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:15,860
do

173
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,959
begun a fun call our local legislatures

174
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,610
we call our school board's and ask for
computer science to count as a math or

175
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,470
science credit

176
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,250
in our state said your stay is not green

177
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,670
where you live outside the US and this
fact is true for you too

178
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,930
pick up the phone on Monday and helped
change the sadistic

179
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,910
here's another problem

180
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,560
on there's actually not a way for people
to consist to

181
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,519
are you nationally find data on what the
graduation requirements are

182
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,630
or how teachers get credential to teach
computer science

183
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,050
so if I'm a policymaker I'm a school
board member I actually don't have a way

184
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,959
to know

185
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,240
and I am way behind my neighbors and I
should be embarrassed

186
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,199
and this is a problem for the
policymakers because they don't know how

187
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,579
to fix this problem

188
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,930
like they don't know how to get the
state an aggregate it put it somewhere

189
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,010
that would be useful

190
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,730
but this is for sure something that you
and i could honestly probably fix in a

191
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,490
weekend

192
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,740
like at this friends on Monday we could

193
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,940
rights in Python that automates the
process and I getting this data from the

194
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,540
various

195
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,949
state and local science on and produce
I'm

196
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:31,269
away for policy makers to actually make
good choices

197
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:36,160
around his head X so this is something
that we can actually do

198
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,160
tomorrow Chur

199
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,230
should I take of no aka

200
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,880
is this

201
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,220
is this podium enough is a good kick it
here's the problem

202
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,569
a computer scientist of hot in Java

203
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:03,290
and I'm not hitting on Jonah like not
because it's cool

204
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,550
john is a great language in a lot of
contacts the job is a problem for CS

205
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,730
education because it is a bad language
to teach in

206
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,910
and I'm not saying this teachers say
this me think about it here in a Java

207
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,720
program think about which goes into
hello world in Java

208
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,120
is very hard to differ talking about
classes headed to differ talking I did

209
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
oriented programming it's a total
nightmare

210
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,329
if you've never written a for loop
before and actually just be a quick

211
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:32,839
picture hands here taking out a walk
down memory lane

212
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,850
arm to who didn't UTPA BCS exam

213
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,160
in Pascal after yeah now

214
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,170
yeah feedback on steep of class so it's
impossible to class

215
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,170
k Java goal okay so so job

216
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,370
is have actually been around for a long
time and is getting pretty long in the

217
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,360
tooth

218
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,980
and rubs a problem because it's not a
great way and exciting scenes about

219
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,199
programming

220
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,439
I we have data on this because ends on
people have been gathering data on what

221
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:04,510
languages

222
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,529
colleges use and also what languages
teachers wish they were you saying and

223
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,839
what languages teachers

224
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,750
think they will be using ten years from
now in a compendium called Brians list

225
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,149
which has been going on for for decades

226
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,670
and replaced is really interesting to us
says Python

227
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,140
users here we see that every summer 2012
reads list

228
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,149
pied you're still in third place Java is
has a lock on first still

229
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:35,630
but if you ask teachers what they wish
they were using

230
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:42,630
they all say Python

231
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,770
here's another fact about Reid's list it
was actually last updated in 2012

232
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,640
and the reason is because the way to
read list is gathered

233
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,260
is that a human being calls up a bunch
of other human beings and ask them about

234
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,420
this information

235
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,080
and this sucks for us because if we had
the data for 2012 for 2013 and 2014

236
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,340
we would see Python skyrocketing of that
list

237
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,540
and this matters to us because the way
you back College Board be announced

238
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,130
during organization behind AP the way to
decide what language you use

239
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,340
is based on were industry is trending
towards and what teachers once

240
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,960
cell imagine a world in which

241
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,390
AP Computer Science for tot in Python
imagine a world in which

242
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,010
high school students in their learning
how to program a lot how to program a

243
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,620
python

244
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,310
like that would be an amazing world for
us for a long-term

245
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,250
you for the longevity of the language
will also be a more fine computing

246
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,500
experience and high school

247
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,410
and this is not a pipe dream if we got
the data to college word

248
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,470
this change I think would happen in four
to six years

249
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,630
so you're excited about that possibility
let's get them the date is Vic can make

250
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,640
good choices

251
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,170
good to hear a couple of our policy
opportunities

252
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,980
next up

253
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,490
student engagement there's a really
basic problem here which is

254
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,670
students don't know what computer
sciences so that i won a ticket

255
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,350
high schools almost too late for the
reason we talked about earlier you are

256
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,600
busy training graduate and get the hell
outta there

257
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,100
so we need to engage people before that

258
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,390
we need to provide a earlier
opportunities for exposure

259
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:28,060
and you what I can do this we do not
have term we do not have to invent

260
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,130
how to do this we can hook into a lot of
existing infrastructure

261
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,500
4 engaging students about computing
here's one great example

262
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,960
are the pilots are foundation sponsored
18 tech camp in raleigh-durham

263
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,390
was run by people in this room for
summer camp for kids learn how to

264
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,830
program in Python

265
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:53,590
on raspberry PIs there are groups like
The Girl Scout and Boy Scouts to

266
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,140
are have a ton and experience on
teaching skills to kids

267
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,300
right they have the kids and they have
the infrastructure

268
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,280
they just don't have a program that's
the only piece to the puzzle that they

269
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,880
need

270
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,000
there are times after school programs
where

271
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,240
were kids on especially go through
modules they're learning about

272
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,060
are in their learning about music and
they would love to be learning about

273
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,980
programming as well but they were really
don't have the teachers like the old

274
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,240
they have the computing labs may have
the students

275
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,360
and how the parents excitement but they
don't have the people who know how to

276
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,450
actually do this

277
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:30,360
service idea engaging students directly
is exciting to you

278
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,390
it's actually very tractable problem
just take advantage of existing

279
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,800
infrastructure

280
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,420
you can make a real difference in your
local community airtight have a local

281
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,460
opportunities here

282
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,960
a couple soon engagement options

283
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,130
number three supporting teachers

284
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,250
here they sad fact of life

285
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,800
for CS teachers if your computer science
teacher in high school

286
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,000
you're probably the only one your high
school to imagine if you went to work

287
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,270
today and you're the only person who did
what you did

288
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,170
and if you had a problem for you had a
terrible day at work you didn't really

289
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,560
have anyone to talk to you

290
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,330
if your stock on something if you
working on cricket Obama you don't know

291
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:13,830
what to do

292
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,209
you don't have anybody to talk to you
this sucks

293
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,300
but we have a huge community let's bring
man

294
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:27,270
into it there are a lot of really easy
ways to support teachers

295
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,930
once upon a service call a person an
email your a local teacher teacher at

296
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,250
your local high schools okay

297
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,390
i think is really cool you're teaching
computer science

298
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,860
and if you have any questions about
curriculum stuff for your sake I boger

299
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,560
environment so that you can buy it

300
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,520
I would love to help argue BT A in the
class

301
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,070
or offer to visit the class and and tell
the kids would really like to be

302
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,920
a programmer your brain to local user
could agree with a camera kirkum

303
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,480
problems

304
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,390
be on all of us at our local Python
project night sela to really easy ways

305
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,370
to support teachers just by bringing man

306
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,340
into the community

307
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,300
number for curriculum development this
is this is really interesting is a

308
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,190
really interesting time for Python

309
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,160
in this area so what exciting things did
you know but there's a new advanced

310
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,120
placement computer science

311
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,320
class as being piloted right now

312
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,100
in the United States is called CS
Principles and this is really exciting

313
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,090
to me

314
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,340
because look at what it focuses on

315
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,760
if some programming but also a lot of
really interesting ideas that will

316
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,990
appeal to a much broader range students

317
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,010
pairing programming with creativity and
data and the internet how to make it

318
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,390
impact with the skills

319
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,100
this seems like a really exciting way to
increasing engagement where

320
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,180
the apcs a hasn't

321
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,620
on but unfortunately there's actually no
did a CS curriculum 4

322
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,950
AP computing principles

323
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,050
in any language and I C span i guess i
say hey this is like a huge market

324
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,270
opportunity for Python

325
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,130
like money if the most awesome way to
teach kids

326
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,480
this AP curriculum was in Python
everyone would use it

327
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,950
right teachers have a limited amount of
time a Thursday bangin

328
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,720
I'm curriculum make use of a shelf
they're going to use it most

329
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,540
teachers on have the time to invent
their own curriculum on a fly

330
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,080
and the stuff seems so cool here's an
example the lesson plans from the

331
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,980
website

332
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,050
crypto graffiti like Alex Gaynor where
are you let's write this car parking lot

333
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,120
in together

334
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,480
data as arts inventing and sorting
algorithms this is fine mist of and we

335
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,450
just need

336
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,690
I is enhanced tackling this problem

337
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,140
and this is also sonya transcends your
national boundaries

338
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,720
on there just aren't that many curricula

339
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,000
that that meet their curriculum
guidelines for schools

340
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,890
but you can use to teach programming in
high school

341
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,480
get here's a good example is actually
surfing Python my favorite introductory

342
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,190
tax

343
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,620
written by alan dow name is probably in
this room on

344
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,070
it's great at the college level but on
there are some problems with tactically

345
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,080
deploying this and high schools

346
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,040
which is includes that you're off in a
really locked down computing environment

347
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,630
are not so what one person I talk to you
measuring about how

348
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:35,190
no in his computer lab and in addition
every me firewall of

349
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,130
on even the teachers don't have the
ability to install software on machines

350
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,210
Anish for good measure they would glue
gun shot

351
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,640
the USB ports system like a duck

352
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,520
as their only option in if this is your
computing environments to do stuff

353
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,370
in the browser right and people love
Python so much

354
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,840
that there is some people are have
created a project it's all open sources

355
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,080
online on github

356
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,880
that ports thing Python to an
interactive web

357
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,940
curriculum

358
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,750
and perhaps the most famous or the the
most-used example has right now is

359
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,890
sculpt which is a javascript and
traditional Python that is used by

360
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,210
course era

361
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,450
the teach hundreds of thousands of kids
a program but here's the thing:

362
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,650
this is online on get hard and there are
things that teachers what's called

363
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,960
to do that it can't deal there are Open
tickets on get hub

364
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,660
for things they wish they could do.

365
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,770
I'm good at fixing bugs bye week whether
we want this to be the case or not it is

366
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,710
possible that the future of teaching
programming in teaching Python in

367
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,300
schools is

368
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,990
in the browser so we should pay
attention to that

369
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,300
shouldn't be a sideline issue

370
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,320
so you're into n their attire really
interesting Creek you landed on

371
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,750
opportunity is for us specifically in
the context of teaching

372
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,260
programming to kids

373
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:04,260
better for big areas that is my fires
for you

374
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,419
and what kind of interesting about
there's a first time for such terrible

375
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,500
absolute numbers in such terrible
percentages but it really doesn't mean

376
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,010
bad

377
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,210
if UN I do one thing it has the
potential to make a significant

378
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,850
impact on these numbers to make a
significant impact on the bottom line

379
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:33,400
and also fortunately we are part of the
community has incredible network of

380
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,580
support to how

381
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,020
I S make these changes in the world we
have the Python Software Foundation

382
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,659
and we will give you money and we will
connect you with people and we will give

383
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:43,700
you resources

384
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,539
if you are willing to take that time to
reach in Turkey your community

385
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:51,230
and make one of these changes so here
are a couple ways we can help

386
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,710
running sprints

387
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,100
hey if you're excited about your sexy
nurse call to buy eggs

388
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,320
we will feed you pizza why you do it
enough your friendly

389
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,669
in that unit with your group local user
group we have in our region Education

390
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:06,309
Committee

391
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:09,679
specifically devoted to doing this kind
of outreach

392
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,250
on you now if you wanna run a tech camp
I'm doing is designed curriculum like

393
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,159
we can help find that this happening and
then we also have a general grants

394
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,169
program sour

395
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:23,080
now let your imagination go wild really
anything is possible and and where we

396
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,120
would be excited to hear from you

397
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,340
okay

398
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,770
who challenged here here gonna be back
here in this room

399
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,450
a year from now am I ask is do one thing

400
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,179
just one thing whatever resonated with
you all you have time for us to call

401
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,130
someone

402
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,350
do that if you wanna run a sprint to do
that

403
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,190
you wanna help it the summer camp do
that but do one thing

404
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:55,669
much report back next year and see how
those numbers see how that bottom line

405
00:23:55,669 --> 00:24:01,919
has changed here a couple resources for
you some classic

406
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,539
tax on why things are the way they are
as well as

407
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:09,150
I'm saw all the data that i've been
reporting at all are publicly available

408
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,710
see you wanna check it and you're now
sees you are Apsley able to add

409
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,360
this is my pitch to you thank you all so
much

410
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:23,360
for listening if you want to talk more
about this

411
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:34,690
half thank you

412
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,459
so I would love to talk with you all at
yeah I'm headed home for the summer

413
00:24:39,459 --> 00:24:44,320
basically and Leslie so I will first
I'll be at the rally with the expo hall

414
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,299
and directly after the the break are at
the break on and I would love to hear

415
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,940
the study gotta get free stuff like free
books

416
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,909
at at the booth I'm but I'm also you
know happy to talk for hours and hours

417
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:55,639
over dinner

418
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:59,509
so thank you so much and I look forward
to seeing what we do in the upcoming

419
00:24:59,509 --> 00:24:59,940
year

420
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:06,940
the horror stories war stories

421
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:13,489
good stories I homeless addition

422
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:17,029
are as much as you can in royal

423
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:20,099
university students was a

424
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:24,239
they can help bettered each young kids
by Tim

425
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:28,159
compared to teachers may be good they
can relate to in also

426
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,200
force you was in her new to programming

427
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,609
the best way to learn is to teach and is
better side but

428
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:39,849
gets but if in both university students
I did take them to you a city or

429
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:44,479
get one appears to high school up the
kids can relate more to us

430
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:48,950
then the teachers thank you and is
teaching teachers problem in particular

431
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,139
is really interesting

432
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:53,229
I'm in the US but also a lot of other
places

433
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:56,749
empty going to you at the UK right now
be people are starting to realize this

434
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:59,879
is important our passing policies that
say hey we're going out is hinting at a

435
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:00,389
program

436
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:03,389
but we actually haven't figured out how
to teach teachers how to teach

437
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:04,859
programming at scale

438
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:08,389
so that's a whole interest in Canada
forums as is worth thinking about

439
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:11,629
thank you you 100 percent II a

440
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:14,959
can have had something related to the
use in this AM

441
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:20,679
as mark a question a on speaking with
the teachers especially the science

442
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,839
teachers because

443
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,289
size becoming so much more
interdisciplinary and

444
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:30,119
unit the University levy see everyone
needing programmers to do things for

445
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:35,599
biologist mathematicians do and did you
see any the teachers at the high school

446
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,559
level

447
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,489
wanting to learn how to program and what
was there feeling about that

448
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:47,929
soon hit I think that the state in power
in house was actually pretty depressing

449
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:49,139
and porcelain particularly his

450
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:53,829
schools don't have a bucket computer
science often in the business

451
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:58,359
silo and not in their science silo in it
there was music like the people

452
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,299
available

453
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:04,049
to teach maybe don't super match that
that the skill set that is required

454
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:07,469
on I think lots of teachers are excited

455
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:10,989
about the idea to do his program and
they're frustrated by the fact that

456
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:12,279
there's no credentialing

457
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,799
and aren't like clear classes are they
can take

458
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:20,789
to on to learn the skills they need to
actually do it

459
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:23,839
I'm sad I think I think excited but
they're fresher IT infrastructure

460
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,579
problems

461
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:28,479
make Jessica

462
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:31,909
caroling I do outreach and San Diego

463
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:36,960
and for the Fab Lab and I haven't
seventeen year old and a 19-year-old

464
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,700
I'm worked with teachers and wanna

465
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,320
the really I'm relatively new to Python
in last couple years and one other

466
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,299
super cool things even be on language
which i think is so fun the program in

467
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,359
is the breath I'll

468
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,769
libraries on the things you can do

469
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:01,989
in astronomy music a biology

470
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:06,489
those are things that really resonate
with kids

471
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:10,999
and kids are sort of sucking up the
Instructables and that kinda stuff from

472
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:11,379
like

473
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:16,499
late elementary school on and it seems
like we've got a great community of

474
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:18,659
people with a variety of interests

475
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,329
it would be really nice if like the
Python Software Foundation could somehow

476
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:27,219
even just I Python no perks on cool
subjects

477
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:32,799
and have sir the clearinghouse for them
even beyond just the formal curriculum

478
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,929
because I think if you touch the kid and
engage the kid

479
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:39,859
they will suck it up they're like
sponges

480
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:42,859
cell I totally agree and in particular
yeah

481
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:47,099
if a bunch of us are going go out in the
schools and we want give our best pitch

482
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,789
for why I programming is empowering
interesting

483
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:53,359
you're having a clearing house in and
suggestions just

484
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:59,659
pre pre-written press it would be really
useful out first just a reminder sending

485
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:03,289
what is the base of logarithm in your
ratio chart

486
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:06,690
I am at a2

487
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,779
now I think so and okie thank you and
the actual question is

488
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:14,179
I'm are there in you are efforts to

489
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:18,249
lets a cold sores them I curriculum

490
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:21,519
creating the effort because to me it
sounds like a problem that

491
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,440
technology console 50 your treasure map

492
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,509
crowdsourcing I mean I wouldn't call it
that is certainly there are distributed

493
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:31,529
efforts on line that are happening for
sure

494
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:34,849
Eminem I find it incredibly encouraging
that the thing that has evolved as

495
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:35,599
people

496
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,200
developing some unease to tools yeah in
the open

497
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,879
under permissive license on Getty up but
actually a a pretty good said in the

498
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:46,450
world so any get collaborating on the
staff

499
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,569
get a crowdsourcing a sub is absolutely
possible way to see the people

500
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:53,319
do it and people who are who are talking
to teachers while they're doing it like

501
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,569
doing it in a vacuum

502
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:57,419
probably wouldn't be successful but you
engage in the people who will be using

503
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,539
the common

504
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:03,429
I'm I I come from a country called Oman
in the Middle East

505
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:07,779
and I'm over there I'm quite privileged

506
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:11,579
in terms of economic status and so on I
live here in Montreal now

507
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:16,109
but computer science is not a respected
I'm

508
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:20,219
discipline in the middle east by the
people who are in the upper middle class

509
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:23,460
and upwards the decisionmaking
policymaking people

510
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,619
I was wondering if you know any groups
who

511
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:29,889
or projects at work towards raising
awareness because I'm pretty sure I can

512
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:32,829
count on one hand or two the number of
people I know

513
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:36,190
were intact for my country on

514
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,599
and that's a real shame and

515
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,249
you know there's such as an opportunity
there to get people involved but

516
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:47,569
you know everything here is about
getting it to work

517
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:50,559
in a place where it already respected
but it is not even respected how do we

518
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,779
go about that

519
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:56,759
yeah it's really a question on there
certainly resources that are somewhat US

520
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:00,719
Pacific that I can say like Co .org has
allotted

521
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:03,929
data and glossy material to present

522
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,399
in your own way to treat digestive or
the people and something that may

523
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,359
translate

524
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,399
across national boundaries then we can
talk to find out more international

525
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,599
efforts into space

526
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,440
agreement hi I have two questions

527
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,649
a the the first one is our what is the
role

528
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:23,339
or how do you see the role of our Khan
Academy

529
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,979
in or similar online

530
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:30,009
kinda like universities or schools

531
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:33,539
from and the second one is I'm

532
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:38,069
is there any the centralized 'em

533
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:41,879
curriculum or centralize project that
house definitive

534
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:45,309
time time line or people dedicated to it
because

535
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:49,779
um Brett like we the first step of
solving a problem is identifying India I

536
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:51,579
think he did a very good job

537
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:55,200
explaining what the problem is arm and
things we could do

538
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,379
arm but I think I getting

539
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:02,960
a rallying people is a good step but we
also need

540
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,979
arm a good project with

541
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:09,869
people they can raise hands and say I
can do this specific thing

542
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:13,479
and it might not be only decentralize to
this room so

543
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:17,859
what's water than your next steps on on
this rallying call:

544
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:21,299
and here those are by two questions got

545
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:24,309
I think I can ease grade and it's great
because

546
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,499
it is on it clearly is delivering value
to a lot of students in a lot of

547
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:30,159
teachers and because

548
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,960
it is and yeah it is one of many actors
in this space irv

549
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,210
on massive online learning and that the
more competition there is there that the

550
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,279
more we learn about what is a fact and
the better it will be

551
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,639
on don't tell you the second question

552
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:51,079
I I think that what people folks
finalists are doing this is is

553
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:55,219
that I'm a lot in these initiatives are
necessarily super local

554
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:59,109
so so how you there are mailing lists
for people interested in a7 our mailing

555
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:00,440
lists for

556
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,049
for teachers interested in programming
on but fundamentally it's

557
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:07,429
your every every school and every school
district is

558
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:11,700
difference and you end up on meeting
with the people locally who who

559
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,049
on know how to make it work in in that
particular context

560
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:19,309
so so or so while there are worse on
your mailing list in

561
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:21,169
national/international at on

562
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:24,470
ways to connect with people I think that
fundamentally these are problems are

563
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,190
solved

564
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,749
piece by piece locally are you going to
track it

565
00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:36,389
I'm I i cant I die I don't have a
solution to this whole problem

566
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:40,369
appear on the stage but I'm sure that if
there's interest in that type of project

567
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:44,259
I we could think it's thanks

568
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,829
you mom third mentioned the the teaching
teachers problem

569
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:51,839
arm in one actions you didn't mention
was actually

570
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,159
programmers becoming teachers arm

571
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,409
is that something you you know

572
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:02,429
in US teaching certificate or as the
difficult career

573
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:05,929
challenging I'm we would do you think
about that

574
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:09,819
love a programmer's actually become
teachers yet at the really question

575
00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:15,720
on so B&B teachers really hard and
teachers go through a ton of training

576
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,980
on to become really good at what they do
and I have a lot of experience and make

577
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,500
some good at what they do.

578
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,190
I'm and and hour if he if you

579
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,609
were trained as a programmer you
definitely can be a good teacher but

580
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:31,970
there's a lot of context around teaching
pedagogy that you you would have to

581
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,279
catch up on to be as effective as you
can be

582
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:38,649
so that's about one aspect I think TPA
teaching

583
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:42,929
add p.m. developing the infrastructure
so that people who were trained as

584
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:45,139
teachers can become computer science
teachers

585
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:49,559
on is probably a good idea even if we
can tap into some external resources to

586
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,440
get teachers and

587
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,220
your promise and there's an insider's
problem you have to really love teaching

588
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,889
kids

589
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,299
to dump your of free food and

590
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:01,789
$250k job to go make 40k

591
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:05,119
innis yet in an environment that is
really really tough

592
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,339
and yeah solidarity that some

593
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:13,500
I'm I'm so I met a couple teachers and

594
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,349
for our live by a school the other day
and on when the ladies is really gone

595
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,009
her she teaches web design

596
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:22,359
and she's awesome and she wants to teach
my time but it

597
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:27,250
Sun is just not encouraged so what
they're doing is on the person is

598
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,509
teaching programming at the high school

599
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:33,680
on is usually like one in the US
teachers on the land is lowest in a

600
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,660
temple

601
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,099
and they do not want to teach it so an
S&D has and knows nothing about that

602
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:42,170
computer science says nothing about
program and could really care less

603
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:46,480
on and so right now there's a one in
teaching and on

604
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,759
her comment the other day well as that
on

605
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:53,859
she really didn't care about it and that
and there were a lot of girls in the

606
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:55,279
class and she said

607
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:59,630
financially programmers anyway on so I'm
just very frustrated

608
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,690
you know charleston south carolina
minutes you know a little backwards

609
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:07,239
but on I I is it's very frustrating to
hear that and

610
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:11,299
on you know as there's some people
they're sending us back in its actually

611
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:15,020
some other women are anchor setting the
women that and I don't get it

612
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,650
I don't know what to do I don't know
what to do with that year the change is

613
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,910
gonna be slow if you'd be incremental
but it will definitely happen

614
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,279
yeah if we put our collective efforts
together %uh

615
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:29,859
will converge on a thing you wanna see
here I definitely believe that

616
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:33,529
pay I just wanted to shut out one more
organization one that I don't think I

617
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:34,500
heard you mention

618
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,690
black girls poet is enough you big
cities across the country

619
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:43,009
arm I volunteered with them when you
show up your

620
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:46,849
only to commit to a single day usually a
Saturday eight hours

621
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:50,839
and the experience it you have with
those middle school girls

622
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:54,509
does it all reflect within the
presentation they're excited they're

623
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:56,880
engaged they learn quickly

624
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,450
and it is that the wonderful thing to do
so if you've got a free Saturday

625
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,670
and they're in your area or you wanna
bring to your area

626
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,880
strongly encourage you to make it happen
Ass'n cock

627
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,579
a game at early engagement is is so
critical

628
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,809
Center really have a question I'm gonna
hijacked the might cure for minutes make

629
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:16,150
an announcement

630
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,270
um I had the privilege of seeing an
alpha version is talk down at Pi

631
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,220
Tennessee

632
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,309
and as a result in conversation that I
had with some people there after that

633
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:28,690
I was back down in nashville two weeks
later for workshop called click

634
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,869
arm the idea behind click was to put 50
working software developers

635
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:37,089
in 50 teachers in a room together let
them get lightning talks tell stories

636
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,630
talk about problems and solutions

637
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,250
and then spend the afternoon coding a
project together in scraps

638
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,119
just as away as sorry develop those
teachers support relationship suggests

639
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,210
it was talking about so um I'm actually
I want the organism cope i

640
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,890
and in Columbus the local paper on user
group along with a number of other

641
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,809
sigues

642
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:00,380
in central Ohio we are going to do click
Columbus

643
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,779
in first quarter of 2015 arm if anybody

644
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:07,390
is in the room from Ohio and you want to
get involved were in the very early

645
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,220
stages of planning this

646
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,270
on the guy one around the conference
wearing a pile higher t-shirt

647
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,579
find me thank you acid in it sound like
a model that could definitely be

648
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:18,920
replicated in other cities and at that
screen

649
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,569
the last question now your are several
years ago maybe five or seven I

650
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,969
actually contacted my old high school
program teacher

651
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:32,890
and I'll given open-ended have what can
I do to help

652
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:37,539
with the bring up how love love the game
here I'm

653
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:41,559
I'm very involved in local geek
community

654
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:45,789
and would love to help and have gave me
a

655
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:49,480
well get back to you and never did

656
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,520
and have

657
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,549
that was it so do you have any count
pointers for

658
00:38:56,549 --> 00:39:00,950
alright well i really wanna help my
local community how do I

659
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,630
how do i crack that not how do I get in
there in and

660
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,900
get to the people who may be willing

661
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,250
to engage with the local

662
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,190
community are to bring in that help to
make it happen to have any thoughts on

663
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,349
that

664
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:19,719
yet you know it teachers are a tough
spot made they are

665
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:23,059
teaching everything her in the trenches
every day and I had a very much time

666
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:26,430
to to plan outside and when you're
actually teaching and I think that

667
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,650
to the senate you can give specific
actions that you can take

668
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,890
on that and it harder for them to
consider the options in and get back to

669
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,859
you if you say hey

670
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:41,930
I noticed there all over your students
are dunes I would like to help fix that

671
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:42,599
