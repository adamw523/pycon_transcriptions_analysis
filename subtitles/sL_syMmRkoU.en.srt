1
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:04,910
good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,740
our next speaker just the McAllen area
is an entrepreneur

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,150
software engineer an open-source
contributor from cambridge massachusetts

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,740
she is coordinator a boss in Python

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,750
the largest tight on me up in the world
and runs the bite

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,500
the Boston Python workshop she's
maintainer for the twisted an open hatch

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,430
projects

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,740
and on top of that she is cofounder and
CT oh I'm still up

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,219
in enterprise messaging service that was
acquired by Jack box last month today

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:38,540
she'll be talking to us

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,950
about security solutions and sandboxing
with Python

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,100
please give her a warm welcome everyone

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,100
thank you so much RSS never going to
talk about building and breaking a

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,629
python sandbox

15
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,180
in this is me I'm also director for the
Python Safra Foundation a

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,250
I am probably too involved in the Python
community

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,089
I hear a couple ways to get 100 okay so
W sandbox

18
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:08,799
why would we ever want to do this this
actually comes up in a lot of

19
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,909
a surprising number contacts I'm when
learning a language

20
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,710
I want to write some companies on a
provider hosted scratch pad for doing

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,110
arbitrary computation

22
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,320
on their son researchers using
distributed computation across major

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,650
platforms we need to run on trusted code

24
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,930
your contacts Anderson cases are you
want to inspect

25
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,950
running processes safely worse and Mark
might be helpful for San Martino di to

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,710
run on trusted Python code

27
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,220
on and their lot examples of us know
what and wild

28
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,900
I'm seattle is an academic peer to peer
computing network

29
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,220
I've Google App Engine has a a Python
shell you ever use code: Academy

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,259
are the uses and Python %uh service to

31
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,350
to profile on sandbox and check I know
who i think is the first startup

32
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,610
row here I is there's an online coding
gain that you execute arbitrary

33
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,149
I thank God and if you have visited the
Python org

34
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:04,670
website post redesign friend center on
the front page

35
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,170
is I a python rebel as this is running a
arbitrary code in a sandbox

36
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,540
and we have two big choices

37
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,250
but we were too big options when
building a sandbox to do language level

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,610
sandboxing worse or going to focus on a
stock

39
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,489
I'm in OS level sandboxing on

40
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,760
end users or to model by the pie sandbox
project and pipe I sandboxing model

41
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,040
are and they're will talk about so the
pros and cons of each letter in the talk

42
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,450
about

43
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,840
we're gonna stay with my we love them
back in because a lot of by and it gives

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,519
us an excuse to dig into some fun
language details

45
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,470
okay is our most fundamental question
here is how do you execute arbitrary

46
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,670
Python code in the first place

47
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,030
I we have two main premise for this we
have al

48
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,489
which compiles and evaluate expressions
an expression is really just

49
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,019
some stuff it reduces to a value like
one close to you

50
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:59,659
and an exact compiled evaluate
statements statements are

51
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:03,159
you know the smallest stand-alone Chung
said Python code

52
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,310
I'm exec is more general because yes are
all paid on programs are made up a

53
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,170
statement so use exactly as the basis
for sandboxing

54
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,620
model also have a little test harness
here we have a sandbox in class is

55
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,030
really simple it is has one method
execute

56
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,030
which takes occurred string and execs
and okay cool so what left testis

57
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,980
I'm so we'll criticism for sandbox class
and we have through a simple cable as

58
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,900
print hello world

59
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,629
and will execute that code and his works

60
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,690
great okay so it will now her in a
sandbox that will execute anything

61
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,980
and but it works good okay so what are
some things that we should disallow

62
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,010
in our sandbox has rang I'm trusting
user can

63
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,430
I a lot of options are you

64
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,760
we definitely I'm we don't want people
to usable the file descriptors

65
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,480
we probably gonna be able to start a web
server is doing it on paying

66
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,650
I'm aviation you were a router the
sandbox said maybe Signori in sensitive

67
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,260
information for the filesystem

68
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,330
as is the partial is there a lot of
things to worry about for gonna run I'm

69
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,220
trusting can

70
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,299
to you know focus other discussion let
let's use the ability to write to the

71
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,220
file system

72
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,850
as a good example of something that are
our most basic sandbox not allow

73
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,799
because I represented only two probably
do a lot of other things that are going

74
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,590
without system

75
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,330
a reason to think that we're going to
focus on the stock is i the ability to

76
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:25,940
write

77
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,110
to a file we definitely want to possible
took early this as possible

78
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,340
on how can we prevent okay well

79
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,780
what is file exactly

80
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,410
if we do some poking around the rebel
I'm off I'm at

81
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,150
on every program in this dubliners were
built ins

82
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,590
I'm filers in there so files one of the
built-ins

83
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,330
in Python and are a lot of others are
filed kinda problematic there a lot of

84
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,460
other potentially problematic

85
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,860
daughters that we might want to disallow

86
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,259
INR sandbox so how do we disallowed the
execution a problematic built-ins

87
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:09,050
starting to build up the functionality
for sandbox

88
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,870
so we are you an idea just the amps
divine what a keyword

89
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,900
blacklist so I okay here you can use
file you can't use a Val

90
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,580
you can't quits was just like you were
passing the code string

91
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,590
if we see the word file in our code
string

92
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,340
I raise a valuer and is that a lot you
actually exiting and

93
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,870
okay tumbling apostle idea and I've ever
tried this with a keyword blacklist

94
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,919
this one fact fail with our value where

95
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,240
good start can get around this blacklist

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,850
3 thinking we're scheming thinking like
attackers

97
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,580
ago here's why do you have an encryption

98
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,680
and not even super sophisticated
encryption encryption what if we

99
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,009
just did this well we just dropped 13
incurred the word file

100
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,860
so the literal text file never appears
in our program

101
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,729
but we can be decoded and lookit up in
the built-in dictionary now we have a

102
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,710
reference to this file object

103
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,340
I'll we know we can write to the file
system

104
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,949
and so we do this unit in fact works
right because we know our block you were

105
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:23,240
blacklisted ever literally peers Nick
your blacklist

106
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,830
ok it's a blacklist not so hot an idea
an enemy I'm sorry she hears I can get a

107
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,400
reference to something that I can invoke
I can name doesn't super matter is the

108
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,319
actual reference that matters

109
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,110
okay well how can we remove all
references to problematic built-ins

110
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,360
ago a blacklist didn't work so well but
how to whitelist

111
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,949
a building's whitelist so you know we
could we could literally have a set that

112
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,590
a numerate saw love the

113
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,979
adult and that we deem okay and only use
out the ones

114
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:56,990
that we think are bad on and then before
we actually execute any code

115
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,280
we could I'm take this original bill
clinton's

116
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,389
on and then iterate over I'm all in

117
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,919
the original dolphins IQ's and if it's
not in the white list was deleted

118
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,910
does not in a myspace anymore

119
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,440
got some pretty good let's write so we
removed file file was not in the balkans

120
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,340
whitelist

121
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,509
if we try to execute are our sample can
exact fit

122
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:25,050
fails so files literally not to find my
files on a continent space anymore

123
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,349
sweet built-ins whitelist

124
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:35,349
because I can use file anymore what else
can I do to write to the file system

125
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:39,069
you'll but for import something

126
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:42,580
can I import I can import OS right

127
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,460
like Edinburgh eso no es has an open I
function that

128
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,289
as for similar to file I can use that to
write the file system

129
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,620
and so far this is allowed

130
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,830
Harry print this from happening well the
problem is I can import OS right

131
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,780
how to disallow problematic imports

132
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,379
okay all the while inside you worked
pretty well for the built in so I don't

133
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:09,389
try to import white list as well

134
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,250
but im pretty is kinda interesting I
because there's this mag there's a whole

135
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,039
mechanism around importing

136
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,580
we're going to hook about importing
mechanism so I guess the first question

137
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:17,930
is

138
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,759
how is importing a model work in Python

139
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,330
and every poker an adult is a little bit
we see that there is this double

140
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,090
underscore

141
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:31,030
import on in the built-in dictionary and
if we if we get a reference to that when

142
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,970
given a mauve

143
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,370
a module I'll that does the work and
actually loling at Marshalls appreciate

144
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,880
the namespace great

145
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,990
so using doubles honors were important
but you know we can

146
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:46,519
to manually do the import ourselves
through built-ins

147
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,470
and and what is the expected function
signature for the import or we can just

148
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,300
look at that

149
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,330
on you know in a little to help here I
know see that we need a name

150
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,870
and there's some some global the locals
as much as some other some other

151
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,560
and optional arguments in in a country
singer

152
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,290
call okay so what writer an importer I
meant for starters it

153
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,970
is just gonna print that work here to
prove to other user and own importer

154
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,130
we're gonna print that we are and then
we're gonna use the underlying II

155
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,660
underscore

156
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,550
import I don't pull a little tense

157
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,870
the video this I was it works call

158
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,790
so we've got to the import on mechanism
particularly importer

159
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,070
and now we've done as we can extend this
to on here before actually trying to

160
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,330
import something

161
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,390
we can check if if the name that we're
trying to import is in a modular

162
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,529
whitelist

163
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,209
on it is we we use that underlie
important mechanism and if it's not

164
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:44,320
we I you know block him for you as an
importer

165
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,830
call okay so it's a maybe we want to be
super conservative in the only models

166
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,230
you can import are

167
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,750
like string and Ari and we

168
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,589
replace the on importer that in
built-ins

169
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:02,560
with are safe important limitation
that's using our save my of my list

170
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,560
goal okay so now if we try on using OS
that open

171
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,740
0 I have warnings about meetings

172
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,320
cool let's make that ever happening and
where's my

173
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,910
point okay produce gonna gonna quit this

174
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,360
Avalon meetings that I'm missing okay

175
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,690
Zealand really getting a video and it

176
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,829
okay where Am I

177
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:37,180
God okay

178
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,940
read-back her back okay okay so

179
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,810
we're gonna try to import OS and it
doesn't work anymore because we have

180
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,480
and Pia hope the importer and it's not
on my list

181
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,440
I said okay so while a surfer been quite
for over a sweet

182
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,459
what else to do. can import a case file

183
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,620
what else can we do.

184
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,300
okay was is all hypothetical but what
we've been doing a lot is reminding dole

185
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,360
tens

186
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,370
and if I can play with built-ins then an
attacker could

187
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,060
to: the water really fundamental stuff
in there like me if this is a part time

188
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,540
to you we define true and false

189
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,570
in buildings like what if any Thacker
like set

190
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,870
true equal to false and vice versa

191
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,200
at the very least I could do yeah it's
possible that I could cause all kinds

192
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,029
checks to behave unexpectedly it is it
seems like a bad idea to let people

193
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:28,220
modified offense

194
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,950
so so what's take that off the table but
the questions are how do we make

195
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,100
unable to modify built-ins

196
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,480
thriller Middleton's read-only so how do
you make

197
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,360
some theory only in Python

198
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,019
you another dictionary am we can
subclass a dictionary

199
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:53,190
and why we does raise the value air for
all the things that were done

200
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,370
heated exchange got I guess we have a
read-only built-ins

201
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,550
class you can't you know add or remove
items from this dictionary

202
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,209
but I'm pretty good and we can you know
again before executing a brand has

203
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:05,870
occurred

204
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,870
we can replace the original bill tens
when are read-only version

205
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,300
call

206
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,279
okay so what else can I do' now the main
lesson to be learned earlier

207
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,610
is that if I can get a reference to
something that I can go get can I get a

208
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,050
reference to something bad

209
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,450
anywhere else within Python where can i
poke around to get a reference to

210
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,200
something that I can use to write to a
file system

211
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,070
okay well there's a bunch of funky stuff
in the inheritance hierarchy

212
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,790
why don't we just play around at like
what's his poker an issue we can find

213
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,529
I also like to take a less truth render
unless there's always double unders crew

214
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,800
members I usually just ignoring the two
output

215
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,440
is there anything interesting in here

216
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,800
well as this class after it okay so list
is a typed list

217
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,959
fine the class actually had his own
Ashley bases which

218
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,200
it is on what the objects based classes
are

219
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,300
so this case listed jazz just subclasses
object not not super interesting

220
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,769
and but you can get the base classes
have an object

221
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,480
and you can also do the reverse you can
you can find some places to you

222
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,600
so in this case list doesn't have any
sunglasses but

223
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,070
into does to balls as a class a dense on

224
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:33,070
stirring unique code both subclass base
training

225
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,399
okay so we can get the base classes have
an object to in get the sunglasses an

226
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,829
object

227
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:42,260
and at the base class have list is

228
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,600
object which everything inherits from
right

229
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,949
why are the sunglasses objects

230
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:55,050
I mean interesting lesson things well
okay so that would be a lot of things

231
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,360
okay so this is all over things that
subclass the object class the most

232
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,480
fundamental class

233
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,380
and it is pretty hard to read so why do
we write a little for look make it

234
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,870
easier to see

235
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,589
okay so so we're entering a recycle as
much as per the name or some scanning

236
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:10,959
through this

237
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,149
okay sweet instance ellipsis member
descriptor

238
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:21,060
wait a second you thought you were gonna
file but you're not okay so file we

239
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,730
still have a reference CO

240
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,160
in the wanna sunglasses objects

241
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,350
and what we have a handle to file its
game over right we know exactly what to

242
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,079
do this

243
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,380
so we pull up in a museum we have the
sunglasses we

244
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,269
I'll nope may cancel dictionary mapping
the name tend to the actual reference

245
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:44,570
I'm iPod reference for file we use that
to write to the file system

246
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,970
okay how do you stop that from happening

247
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:54,190
and even if I hear is that we really
shouldn't be exposing

248
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,790
he is implementation details like maybe
just want some cases been made over the

249
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,660
vast majority a program use cases we can
just heidi is from the user

250
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,790
so so let's see if we can just get rid
of the is comming the weak bases

251
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:11,930
sunglasses okay so we're gonna del type
type a sous

252
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,360
shoot but did not work

253
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,820
and the reason it does work because this
is actually the check on doing mess you

254
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,709
can actually set attributes have typed

255
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,250
is imposed by the underlying C Python
implementation

256
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,380
so so we can delete them from C decipher
Python

257
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,850
but fortunately am ever want to invest
will be never would actually work around

258
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,750
that so there's this thing called see
types a Seat Ibiza foreign function

259
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,139
interface that allows us

260
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:41,670
to its own dig into the underlying C
Python gots

261
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,040
on every you see types we can work up a
little

262
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,029
on function that'll give us the
dictionary attack tributes on the

263
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:50,209
underlying

264
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:54,000
C Python implementation for something

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,070
okay cool also so we can rewrite a
missile dictionary I love

266
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,630
of functional we can pull out those the
underlying type text by passing

267
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,300
distillation check and we can tell bases
and sunglasses

268
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,440
that way got ok I'm

269
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,320
okay so no subclasses no super classes

270
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,740
our Q&A what else can we do to write
this filesystem

271
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,180
ok well

272
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,329
back to playing around here okay so
let's say it you know it was

273
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:27,449
it was fruitful first orgasm is random
double underscore

274
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:30,620
attributes on lists why do we were

275
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,660
write a function see there's anything
interesting in a drought put their

276
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,529
guess hasher name right near you

277
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,959
funk code at that sounds

278
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,720
interesting what what is it what is funk
what else is

279
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,750
with Ashley to funk had

280
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,990
court considers the CEO code Ashley have
anchored if you look at see occurred

281
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,060
so yet learned this in some hacks
gibberish I'm a lot which looks like

282
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,630
the actual bite kit that Python
interpreter is is executing

283
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:11,630
but school on surely we can change that
raid

284
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,179
okay so what does I saw a prototype okay
we have our are nice function foo

285
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:19,199
we're gonna ride around evil function
that Prince kaboom

286
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,910
Anne every run through a prince me our
but if we

287
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,910
said but fun kurd attribute on foo

288
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,169
what happens

289
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:35,280
okay that works okay so that seems bad

290
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,220
okay so this brings us back to an idea
we discussed before which is that

291
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,340
'we're careful expand exposing
potentially dangerous in 20 she tells

292
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,910
you up probably the vast majority in
these cases are users don't need access

293
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,070
to a fun kurd

294
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,630
object and actually we can use the same
c-type should come before

295
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,110
to get rid of this so we can use our
dictionary I have function

296
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,610
to to pull out the the attributes I love
that function are you up the function

297
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,190
tired

298
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,610
and I'll be fine cut so it's not
successfully more

299
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,690
cool okay

300
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,679
let's recap okay we try to cure
blacklists then having a bad idea route

301
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:11,559
30 in with a

302
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:15,559
big problem for us there don't invite
list and I was pretty good

303
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,940
and import y listo hooking the importer
are making important objects like

304
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,150
built-ins read-only

305
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,600
subclassing decked I we do we had a
couple problematic imitation details

306
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,970
like bases inside classes and punctured

307
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,039
and then I we deleted the ability to
construct

308
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,080
arbitrary code object which seems pretty
dangerous

309
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,470
sweets and actually I'm we run outta

310
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,600
tricks we have implemented I would say

311
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,510
eighty percent have a full-fledged price
on sandbox where the remaining 20

312
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,820
percent are just edge cases to Ted

313
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,620
you know details in the language on but
if we zoom way way way I can imagine a

314
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,770
single file containing all the coney
written

315
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,890
where first we produce a dozen white
list now we have an import while is to

316
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,360
make buildings read only in like before
you execute any code we believe in these

317
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,080
problematic details

318
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,160
on and then we have a pretty cool our
sandbox

319
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,080
it's pretty cool although we do limit
important functionality either their

320
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
deadly cases where am I gonna be able to
write

321
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,940
to a file even in the sandbox and also
we think back to the things we say we

322
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,270
should disallow

323
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,770
were not hitting all of these bases yet

324
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,840
like this language level sandbox does
not give us a lot of

325
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,690
I Hawks 4 per any resources ashen like
an immigrant likely if someone decided

326
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,130
her

327
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,190
like create a freedom bit quien minors
on my

328
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,220
server I like I their new ways to stop
them from using up all my CPU resources

329
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,150
on with this implementation

330
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,000
as opposed to going back to serve our
choices here our choices elaine was on a

331
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,140
sandbox really fun to explore

332
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,250
or no es little sandbox and actually
that

333
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,000
the code we're in which is based on
price and box relook at Big Data get

334
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,570
herb

335
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,679
page for price and what is even a I'm a
nice strong morning at the bottom

336
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm by the author %uh who wrote a really

337
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,780
a thoughtful retrospective on what he
discovered while

338
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,289
building up I sandbox over the years
which discusses a lot over concerns that

339
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,110
we've talked about

340
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,390
and fundamentally it just becomes harder
to you

341
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,730
on rights a language level sandbox that
allows you to do useful stop

342
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,970
on but is also safe

343
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,340
and so his regulation thriller
Commissioner love mostly talk to a

344
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,480
is well who have worked as a box is is
that you need to at least parrot with OS

345
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,950
will send black celebrity OS-two
importers

346
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,130
to enforce resource constraints or I'm
limit your visibility in the filesystem

347
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,390
things like that

348
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:51,640
but is a fun exercise now

349
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,610
here's a look at a food for thought here
so what questions do other languages

350
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,450
have these and boxing concerns

351
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:02,730
well as JavaScript pajama jam

352
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,000
and also we were designing a new
language we have the ability to discern

353
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,870
scratch

354
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,740
and we wanted sandboxing to be a as a
reference a first-class consideration

355
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,480
when designing as

356
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,250
waters and design choices that we make

357
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,030
and you're a couple of I experiment this
is the kind I would do on the weekend

358
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,090
family time

359
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,270
I'm we could look at how pipe as this so
we knew we were looking at we weeks

360
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,390
I you licensee pride on specific details

361
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,809
what you are going to use experiment
house pipe I do it

362
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,570
how exactly does the C-five on an
interpreter compound run by code

363
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,870
I'll what does the Python stack a look
like you know coming from 0 to have a

364
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,080
very clear picture that but is it more
complicated

365
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,890
I found world see types this foreign
function interface you'll have been a CK

366
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,750
that seems like a very nifty trick how
does that work

367
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,370
and then how exactly can be operating
system help provide a secure environment

368
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,090
in this context

369
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,140
suck up a fun experiment so we can
together

370
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,960
not a little bit a bedtime reading you
can see the full price and by

371
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,679
implication

372
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,840
with his eminently readable and I'll

373
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,250
mostly what we've already talked about
on the slides actually I said I get home

374
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,570
on and then again it's really thoughtful
retrospective on pat pat on doctors

375
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,840
challengers another UN are you can read
your pipe I SMIC litigation and how

376
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,010
private anywhere

377
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,490
on the servers that host step and that
org

378
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,970
a sandbox how that works as well

379
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,620
so thank you for coming me on this
journey through this tricky sandboxing

380
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,580
asset up to learn a couple interesting

381
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,600
I language tidbits Anderson exploitation
tricks as we

382
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,620
watch do this thought experiments I'm
not as I have reason to you so much and

383
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,789
also if you are talking about this or
anything

384
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:48,510
I will be a rally booth at the expo hall
tomorrow morning

385
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:55,510
are you free boxer sup thank you

386
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,979
under any questions there are Mikes

387
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:09,639
on the sides yeah

388
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:14,570
I thanks for the talk on this man I
really change the fundamental discussion

389
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,229
very much but what i want.

390
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:20,759
sandbox something like by Python
notebook have people work in that at all

391
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,929
I mean is that something that you could
rent a pipe I use their sandbox like

392
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:28,749
any recommendations on how to do that I
yes I think

393
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:32,440
I mean there are various mature send
back seat certainly OS level say

394
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,769
martinis and a pipe I definitely have to
support an operation to be things like

395
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:36,269
this

396
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:40,229
on so yes I was they don't roll your own
sandbox

397
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:47,229
and do use one that established at
Sandboxie horror stories and his work

398
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,599
maybe JavaScript rb8

399
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:58,599
take pride have some now okay thank you
so much there a lightning talks next

400
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:01,450
first eighteen per day
