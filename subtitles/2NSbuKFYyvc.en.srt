1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,689
I can key on a morning fernando's the
creator and currently developer by

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:04,529
Python

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:11,529
a founding member numb focus and
professor UC berkeley wrong way on

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,420
on hot good morning everyone thanks for
stall to the

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,760
the organizing committee this is only my
second time in Canada my previous one

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,109
was further 2012 Pike on Canada

7
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,140
which was a great event and today I want
to talk about something that served 0

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,840
tells into a Jessica was saying she was
fine mod reaching

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,739
to the next generation are of of
programmers and members of society were

10
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,079
kids and i'm talking about.

11
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,730
the reaching to the scientific community
which is a community that I

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,789
but I belong to and how the the Python
world has actually and that the open

13
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,910
source community had actually had a huge
impact

14
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,379
in what science are is and what signs
does

15
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,140
arm the ideal have signs that aren't
many have you made

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,570
sort of have a a rough sketch what
science is in your head is that we r

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,850
searching for truths about the world
that are verifiable better

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,330
on objective that we validate by
reproducing

19
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,920
on by building upon the work of others
and which is a collective enterprise of

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,850
humanity about understanding nature

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,689
are and I and improving the world and
%uh the reality of Sciences is actually

22
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,290
unfortunately a little bit different

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,460
it's really the the pursued a very
highly cited papers and procedures

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,270
journals to pad your CV

25
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,619
arm validation is basically kind the
referees actually

26
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,150
get my paper through into the Journal
and that they did not receive my coder

27
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,890
my day and they didn't really do
anything

28
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,170
with her with for replicate in my work
arm and it's basically you don't really

29
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,689
have to

30
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:44,880
don't have to outrun the bear remember
so as long as you get funded

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,060
on it doesn't matter what your
colleagues didn't arm

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,020
an open source software is actually a
different community and we've

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,020
I sorta lead a double life from an
academic scientists in a research

34
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,460
scientist at UC berkeley

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,110
arm and %uh but I also sort of softer
suffer developer by night unfortunately

36
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,700
these days by date to

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,340
but Tom but I've learned a lot from this
Community from all the view

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,800
on and I think all other I know there's
many I saw remembers from our scientific

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,099
by the committee in the room and

40
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,690
however I think we've all learned a lot
from you guys arm the

41
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,440
this is a a world that is or open
clobbered by definition you

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,580
with this community builds its software
out in the open arm

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,930
on the Internet its continuous in public
process there is no big

44
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,209
hold everything in secret until you get
the big splash press release

45
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,830
and the big paper published arm the
credit

46
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,410
is naturally distributed its and commit
logs it in the mailing lists and

47
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,319
activities

48
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,989
but happen in public are your ideas get
reviewed in public whether it's a PAP

49
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:44,569
are whether it's a purple request on get
hard arm

50
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:47,739
it's a process which is reproducible by
necessity

51
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,860
you cannot really software and hope to
debug what up what a problem that

52
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,680
someone is having halfway around the
world

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,500
unless you have some machinery in place
to make sure that when they install it

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,390
you have some understanding what's
happening to them so this is a community

55
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,129
has built

56
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:04,280
both technical tools and practices but
make

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,810
things reproducible by nature arm you
expose

58
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,190
your bugs in public that the problems
are tract publicly

59
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,890
and are discussed publicly arm and
testing is part of the system its

60
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,190
it's a mindset of saying we know we make
mistakes we know stopper has bogged

61
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,110
so we build testing into the process and
one of my colleagues Matthew Brett

62
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,159
at berkeley told me a couple days ago he
said you know what one other thing that

63
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,580
really

64
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,680
starting to work with open sores people
talking as how often

65
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,709
I made mistakes in my code the code I
didn't used to test before

66
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,450
in but I published paper was with was
pretty much always wrong

67
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,540
unless I tested it so now I it has
changed the way I think about my told

68
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,200
into buy time for us in the open source
world

69
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,519
have really had a huge impact both in
this broader sense of sort of changing

70
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:51,110
how

71
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,030
we approach the work I've signed but
also more specifically in in in a

72
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,590
tactical San scientific computing is it
is

73
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,459
is something that started in in the
world the floating-point

74
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,180
number crunching for 10 in the fifties
but has evolved in different directions

75
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,019
on the one hand

76
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,310
we do increasingly abstract and complex
things mathematically

77
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,510
arm but we also now it is the business
of scientists today

78
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,910
to actually talk to hardware to talk to
databases this morning was having

79
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,530
breakfast

80
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,400
with somebody who works in Hawai and
writes control soft for the telescopes

81
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,410
in Hawaii

82
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,630
arm that acquire de da in a choir
astronomical images for analysis I work

83
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,850
with college in astronomy

84
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,250
at UC berkeley arm who right exactly
recon mission re very famous astronomers

85
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,169
on and and Nobel laureates work right
exactly like a softer in Python has been

86
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,020
a fantastic tool for the scientific
community because precisely letters

87
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,830
bridge

88
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,050
this huge growth were for train isn't
enough anymore but let us Bridget

89
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,590
by reusing and rebuilding upon all of
that very high quality fortran CNC plus

90
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,500
plus code

91
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,960
that we still do have to use a very very
brief history the slides were given to

92
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,340
me

93
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,530
on West matter to the morning by her by
her by Travis but it's a very very quick

94
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,759
history of how

95
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,910
the numerical core on the pipe in world
came to be tracing back to june fourth

96
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,350
and

97
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,889
and im here going in the nineties who
started what became the numeric library

98
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:13,910
that live we went for round renovations
on called mama Ray

99
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,639
arm be a Peregrine kills leadership on
the Hubble Space Telescope team

100
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,669
and eventually in 2005 try to Solomon
houman many have you know

101
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,639
cannery marriage to an American number
ray efforts into what is today to numb

102
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,350
pie

103
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,370
library and um around 2001 trial disarm

104
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,820
Eric Jones was the founder and fart arm
I hope you're here

105
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,169
Eric I haven't had a chance to see yet
and power Peterson got together and

106
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,330
created

107
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,949
thus I pipe which is both the site by
library but also the site by conference

108
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:45,650
and community that has served as an
aggregator and fart

109
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,100
has played a leading role in basically
shepherding the community over the last

110
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,840
decade

111
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,710
arm and I became kinda our space I
became sort of our world

112
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,680
arm but i wanna bring that story back to
the last couple of months were something

113
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,550
exciting happen and it's proof

114
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,699
but we can have a very meaningful
dialogue with your community

115
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,740
and with the pipe on core team arm this
are in February Nathaniel Smith proposed

116
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,479
who's won the lead numbed by developers

117
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,729
proposed on a act be as a valid
operation in the Python syntax which

118
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,259
would mean introducing

119
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,330
the at character as a new binary
operator to represent matrix

120
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,430
multiplication

121
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,960
armed he wrote a very for a PAP you went
out to all over the scientific mailing

122
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,259
lists for many projects and gather
feedback

123
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:31,199
and on April eighth we dose and are very
short one-line email to

124
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,009
pipe on dad saying I'm not checking the
PAP so you guys can stop joking around

125
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:36,759
there was on a joking thread going on

126
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,380
I guess end and he said okay that set
with weakness is going and

127
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,710
and sold thank you

128
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,720
thank you agreed on a fan on everyone
put work into that and I am very

129
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,870
amazingly

130
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,030
for the day to readers email was April
8th by April 10

131
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,240
the issue on the track was closed
Benjamin Peterson in two days basically

132
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,440
actually implemented

133
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,889
that the paper which was which is
fantastic arm

134
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,569
soap really thank you guys

135
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:09,210
so for aus assigned to spite on gives us
a lot we get

136
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,840
very importantly separation of concerns
we can dump a lot of work

137
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,930
on pipe on dad meaning the work on the
language thinking about the compiler

138
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,900
thinking about

139
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,050
kinda that the syntax of the language we
can have a dialogue about it but that is

140
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,000
mostly

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,300
their responsibility in that look frees
us to do other things on

142
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,780
and your community to build XML libros
and web libraries in all kinds of things

143
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,729
that we use

144
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:33,699
arm it gives us a huge amount of
leverage with all those tools

145
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:37,500
it gives us access and a dialogue with
industry there's a lot of

146
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,750
partners from industry who are many of
those people in those walls

147
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,340
who now there's kind of a natural way
above talking to them for a for a

148
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,349
scientist's

149
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:48,020
and there's also in and I want to
emphasize the so called her and a

150
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,900
community

151
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,870
right the BD FL model arm the PSF the
models are these conferences a lot of

152
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,759
these things are in many ways different

153
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,449
then signs and I would say that they
actually represent those ideals of signs

154
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:00,720
that I was talking about earlier

155
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,530
are better represented arm by our by a
lot of the things that you guys have

156
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,259
done I certainly have learned a ton

157
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:10,030
from from this Community in from working
on pipe on dad from and seeing how these

158
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,229
communities operate

159
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,840
arm but I hope that I can show you that
in the other direction that it really is

160
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,270
a dialogue that goes two ways that

161
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,300
we also contribute arm we build tool
that have broad impact I did a quick

162
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,889
check with the Debian popcorn command

163
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,620
in and numbed by is reported as being
installed Rafi in fifty percent of

164
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,750
Debian installations

165
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,020
that's a lot it means that the
scientists have built a tool that

166
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,669
really is an important pipe onto land
and that benefits many many

167
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,620
packages it ships now in OS 10 out of
the box Mavericks

168
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,990
ships with numbed by and matplotlib onto
can plot

169
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,269
de da are the box in in a in or stand
and it's not just numbed by we have a

170
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,570
big ecosystem these are sort of the poor
packages have the scientific ecosystem

171
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,470
numbed by side by Matt bartlett's Empire
kinda the base layer

172
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,120
arm other scientific ecosystem but we
also have to likes I could learn

173
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,149
and pandas that there have been
tutorials about here for machine

174
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,220
learning in statistics network axe

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,790
for graph theory analysis that Matthew
Russell uses in his in his beautiful

176
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,310
book

177
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,320
psych its image for image processing
sites on which also the

178
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,130
the core language team is now I know
they've had discussions about

179
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,120
so we have a rich ecosystem a federated
ecosystem of tools

180
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,399
but I think our our valuable as well we
bring a different community

181
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,940
which means we bring different usage
patterns have had really great

182
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,930
conversations with Nik Cochran about

183
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,860
how the usage patterns and the kinds in
ways that we use the language is

184
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,430
different and that actually is

185
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,480
valuable because it brings a diverse in
your ideas to that to the community

186
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,010
and going back to what Jessica was
saying well many other scientists

187
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,580
are in academia we teach work
universities which means that

188
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,130
we can expand pipelines reach arm maybe
not exactly in the direction that she

189
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,410
was talking about but there is
overlapping but between those

190
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,140
communities

191
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,100
are for example UC Berkeley and MIT have
recently in the last couple years

192
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,850
changed

193
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,450
our core CS courses from arm

194
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,529
from from scheme to aren't too tight on
and Brooklyn after this we did a really

195
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,980
quick rewrite of the SACP book

196
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,790
that is about as pie pan oriented and
obviously that bad has drawn that has

197
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,500
Paul

198
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,610
arm we we have efforts to reach out to
into the scientific community to suffer

199
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,880
carpentry project

200
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,490
that is hosting a greg is speaking later
today Titus brown is here in the room

201
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,850
was one another one another

202
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,079
our town of dark and leaders in that
effort arm that sets up a carpenter

203
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:26,690
reaches

204
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,610
out to practicing scientists and teaches
them how to do be better computational

205
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,170
our people arm in in as part of their
day-to-day scientific work

206
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,279
I really encourage you guys to engage
that

207
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,269
and there's also something that I think
should be discounted which is that in

208
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:43,959
the last couple years something is
happening there was this big data signs

209
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:44,630
buzzword

210
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,750
and yes it is a terrible buzzword but
it's there arm

211
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,019
in what's interesting about this is a
plot that I didn't make this is copied

212
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:51,600
from

213
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,089
from a blog post that came out looking
and unfortunately the funds are too

214
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:58,890
small for project for projecting but I'm
I was just too damn just using the image

215
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,769
the lines the lines that go but the red
line that is kinda

216
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,070
trending down is are the blue line
that's going

217
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,079
up is I pipe on the Green Line is pipe
on

218
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,779
these are abstracts at the Strada Riley
conference which is the big business big

219
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:13,839
industry

220
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,480
data science and big data conference and
it means python is really playing a role

221
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,000
there and this is because

222
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,360
the school that many of us build for
scientific research all asunder

223
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,130
exploding in industry

224
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,120
and people in cutting companies in an
industry are realizing that the pipe on

225
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,850
stack

226
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,940
for science is actually a great stack
for building those kinds

227
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,610
for working on those kinds of problems
arm and so I think it gives pipe and

228
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,360
reach

229
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,970
and exposure into our own aside industry

230
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,329
that have added that is potentially
going to be a very important problem

231
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:44,300
business-wise

232
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,500
arm there is also interesting changes in
science itself in the funding so last

233
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,240
year

234
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,870
UC-berkeley together with you duh but
NYU we won a competition as a

235
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,899
collaboration

236
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,820
arm for a roughly $38 million dollar
grant from the more foundation and a

237
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,510
strong foundation to build

238
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,240
data science environments whatever that
means over the next five years and

239
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,779
interestingly

240
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:09,160
in our proposal in the Berkeley proposal
Python an open-source were

241
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,230
add the heart of the proposal and in the
emo use

242
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,200
between the three institutions there's
explicit language about open source

243
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,180
software

244
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,839
Connie out of this initiative this was
announced at the white house last

245
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,670
november

246
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,329
arm and at berkeley what we did is we
actually got the university to fund

247
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,680
to create a new institute is called
abruptly sacked Institute for data signs

248
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,220
bids

249
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,540
right now we're remodeling the main
campus library at berkeley to house at

250
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,790
on Tim O'Reilly in pure nordicware our
keynote speakers when we

251
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,510
when we launched the announcement their
arm this is the on the lower left you

252
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,980
had a picture of Katie Hoff

253
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,510
was one of the women who lead the
scientific Python communities wanna

254
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,800
chairs on the organizing

255
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,720
committee for a conference arm with Tim
O'Reilly during our little poster

256
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,430
session

257
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,490
and in the upper right the person on the
lower at the bottom it's all pro martyr

258
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,070
whose

259
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,139
the noble laureate in physics from two
years ago home

260
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,000
miss cover the acceleration and
expansion of the universe and he's our

261
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,980
lead PI

262
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,649
arm and I've been helping him I have
somebody so my tweet about how to teach

263
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:09,110
a girl a young girl arm pipe on a up to
a few months ago that's because Hall

264
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,089
was asking me how to get his hair his
kid into pipe on and soap eitan really

265
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:16,110
is basically playing a role at the heart

266
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,019
are one of the most ambitious
initiatives that we have right now in

267
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,130
transforming

268
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,880
arm science arm in education we're
seeing

269
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,660
this is harvard's CS 109 course in data
science

270
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,570
all over its all it's all pipe on all of
the

271
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,089
homework sets are these absolutely
gorgeous I don't have time to show them

272
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,040
to you in detail

273
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,310
but there it is absolutely gorgeous
extraordinarily elaborate

274
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,930
arm data science problems with fury with
references with de da

275
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,029
are if you want to learn are sort of
really hands-on

276
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:50,769
arm data science goal go through those
lectures and do those problem sets are

277
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,110
absolutely wonderful

278
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,430
arm we've also learned from the PSF and
dog

279
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,290
several of us if you're if you're in the
room arm hat what book got together a

280
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,620
couple years ago in created a foundation
with the help in conversation from folks

281
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,540
at the BSF

282
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,769
called them focus which in many ways
plays a role similar to that of the PSF

283
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:09,290
but in the scientific world

284
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:13,230
arm I encourage you guys to go see Lee s
Highland was one of our

285
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,860
off of that %uh the key people in them
focus and she's here at the continued

286
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,589
if you want to talk about what we're
doing in in problems akin to those at

287
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,240
the PSF has been reaching out

288
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,269
to the scientific and academic
communities with open source code and

289
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:28,029
bridging between academic research and
industry

290
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,160
arm

291
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,480
so this is I I wanna switch gears a
little bit now from from the big picture

292
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,600
open source in science into the one
specific project that I've been involved

293
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,230
with

294
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,820
that Alex mentioned which was our I pipe
on on it began

295
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,000
as me trying to procrastinate a little
bit on on on finishing my dissertation

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,079
and wanting a but many by the way most
of the project when I showed him that

297
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:52,740
slide

298
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,170
but had I can where somebody's the says
postdoc

299
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,149
or 10 your procrastination project are
in the scientific community

300
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:06,240
so a scientist we have a long and proud
tradition of doing that

301
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,680
and i buy them is no exception and began
at me trying to get a better shall

302
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,740
for pipe in part by then had an
attractive shell but it's for limited

303
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,339
on and I wanted something a little
better at the beginning it was a a .259

304
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,430
line scrapped

305
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,769
but basically just hacked into changing
the input and output prompts

306
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:25,720
and added output caching to the prompt
unloaded numerical imparting libraries

307
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,699
et cetera

308
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,769
arm thirteen years later I thought it
was going to be just after noon happy

309
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:30,970
that's what I call my advisor

310
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,779
arm been 13 years and now we have about
a hundred fifty thousand lines of code

311
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:39,779
of 15 power 15,000 commits three hundred
over 30 contributors

312
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,110
arm six languages now there's a la jolla
script and their

313
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,050
arm and its obviously not my work I
really wanna stop for a second

314
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,579
and emphasize that everything that I'm
going to show is really the the print

315
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:52,380
the output

316
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,139
are very talented team our brand Rangers
Mike OPI his ethics professor at Cal

317
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:58,670
Poly in San Luis Obispo

318
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,180
mean um is our lead engineer arm at a
time he got his PhD in plasma physics at

319
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,170
UC Berkeley and he now works there
full-time

320
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,480
the people who are both faced in that
slider simply boldface because they are

321
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,600
full-time developers we now have enough
funding

322
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,290
to have six of us working full time and
Mattias be sunny and was at the top

323
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,850
right is actually here in the room who
the only core developer

324
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,980
who is on was here arm but it bare all

325
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,990
really the ones we do all the hard work
I i don't i'm taking credit for someone

326
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,360
else's work at this point

327
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,490
we have funding that we are very
grateful for on the upper P sloan

328
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,380
Foundation

329
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,940
arm funds to the bulk of the salaries
but Microsoft Research has made

330
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,250
important donations the project and
we're grateful for

331
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,190
on and Rackspace I know you guys are
here thanks a lot because you you got

332
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,800
support

333
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,470
both in services and Kyle Kelly who are
who has become a core developer

334
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,139
are supported by Rackspace arm and so
how did we go from 250 lines of code

335
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,389
250,000 all we do is basically

336
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:54,180
exact exec your source in use are decked
arm

337
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,320
what we do his basically which create a
lot of staff

338
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,360
around language independent tools for

339
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,640
what happens at the shell but an
abstracted fashion I'm gonna show you

340
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,709
examples about

341
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,000
the simplest way that I can describe it
quickly is that we have basically

342
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,350
created a protocol

343
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,049
for interactive systems to talk to
programming languages

344
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,370
so you can think I'm it's sort of like
an HTTP style protocol

345
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,280
but for interactive computing not have a
format for storing

346
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,650
those interactions sort of like HTML but
it's how it's exactly a Jason data

347
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,640
structure

348
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,400
arm at the protocol level we provide
when you install a pipe and we provide

349
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,600
one kernel one of these interactive
colonels it's the I pipe and colonel

350
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,809
what what used to happen just that the
shower now happens over the network

351
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:41,230
we provide three clients the same
terminal client if you've ever used by

352
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:41,770
Python

353
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,770
but also a graphical cutie console
client and a web known book

354
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,480
this is being presented in the web
notebook army

355
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,000
there's a format a format there's an API
for converting

356
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,380
those notebooks into other other forms
about what and that's going to be

357
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,860
important as we'll see in a minute

358
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,880
on we have a notebook sharing service
call NB viewer

359
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,380
are which is hosted by Rackspace is a
mentioned on and we also have a library

360
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,190
for high-level parallel computing

361
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,970
but takes a lot of the ideas from
multiprocessing and concurrent futures

362
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,289
but

363
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,429
on but presents them in a way that is a
little bit more amicable for the kind of

364
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:15,120
thing that we want to do in science

365
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,390
arm so it does execute code and what
does it do well if you

366
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,770
if you simply import some and and you
load a dataset

367
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,020
and you hit enter you can get plots on
this is actual code

368
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,309
where we're planning with matplotlib

369
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,350
and awe and this is you it's plotting
with matplotlib but it's actually using

370
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,179
the 32 to the rendering so two lines of
code will let you load a data file

371
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,549
and Dom and and visualize it quickly

372
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:46,080
we don't have to arm NV and we always
are for being able to do that

373
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,320
but in addition to executing Python code
we can mix and match with other

374
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,200
languages

375
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,480
arm so this is and I apologize if it's a
little small for you guys to see the

376
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,600
code on the back cover and the very back
of the room

377
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,380
but suffice it to say that what we're
doing here is executing inside the pipe

378
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,130
and process

379
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,160
loading a Julia interpret julie is in a
language other than 90 for numerical

380
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,840
computing

381
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,710
and the end the next block is now Julia
code which is making call backs the

382
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,220
Python code in producing

383
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,250
a plot by mixing and matching Julius in
touch with Python syntax to

384
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,010
generate a figure using matplotlib from
an internal reloaded

385
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,299
Julie interpreter and job but the the
integration between the languages goes

386
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,480
pretty deep and Julia we created this
figure

387
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,799
and we pull it out and display it as a
pipe on variable and we can keep

388
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,210
modifying it afterwards

389
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,190
as a bite on data structure arm you can
even mix and match at the level

390
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,720
of having thus the call stack be
completely intermingled so this is an

391
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
example a writing the classic fibonacci

392
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,679
are little example from the python
tutorial but as a two-step recurrence

393
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,090
that a one-step recursion

394
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,090
where now one version a few notches
written julia and the other one is

395
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,809
written in Python and when you call

396
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:53,809
the outer entry point that switching
back and forth between the two

397
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,850
and you can see how the two step records
in stock unfolds

398
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,840
arm in there so this did these are the
kinds of things that we can sort of do

399
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,570
cleanly

400
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,789
without with the iPad from colonel

401
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:08,520
we can arm as I said we can load data
and look at it let's imagine that I have

402
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,120
an image

403
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,309
with in this case some random values in
imparting and I'd like to know

404
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:17,030
well where r Wareham what where are the
higher values economically start

405
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,409
start thresholding this image and Dom
and looking out and playing playing with

406
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:22,500
a threshold to see were

407
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,700
were important values in this case said
it's random noise but normally do these

408
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,150
kinds of things with real data

409
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,740
arm but this is the kind of thing where
it's very useful to be able to have

410
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,760
interactive controls and so we've added
we've added the ability to simply grab

411
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,340
save applying showed applauding call but
chose the image

412
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,950
threshold how to value and simply say I
want that but I wanted interactively

413
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,549
with a slider that goes between 2n 2n by
simply writing that by simply saying I

414
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:49,659
want to interact with that

415
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:53,530
I automatically get a slider which
allows me to change the image threshold

416
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,820
and whenever a move

417
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,380
that slider its it simply calling back
into the kernel from the JavaScript side

418
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,730
calling back into the kernel we
executing the code and letting me so I

419
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,120
don't know how to write Grieco denied
open already old enough and I without

420
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,450
reading the Evergreen code

421
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,360
but I but it is useful to have
interactive controls for primary

422
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,409
exploration of 10

423
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:14,490
and being able to write just one line of
code and saying I want iraq with a fresh

424
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,340
whole argument

425
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,250
is extremely extremely useful and
certainly for us in scientific work

426
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,289
where we often have to play with
parameters

427
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:24,500
be able to bid do this kind of thing
easily is very nice

428
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,480
arm and now that we have this connection
between what happens in the web browsing

429
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,700
what happens in the back and

430
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,460
we can build things like spreadsheets
but where r than a nice aspect but I

431
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,679
like about spreadsheets

432
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,850
is being able to many people ate the
data entry aspect I don't like the fact

433
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,140
that the blend in

434
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,620
data input and output arm so this is an
interview with a toy example again but

435
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,539
to show the kinds of things that become
possible

436
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,289
cue and and loading a data frame are
planned as a defendant in this case has

437
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:54,280
random numbers and if that's what it
looks like when I printed

438
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,200
and if I simply Colleen arm

439
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,679
the added function this is a little
JavaScript table where I can now go in

440
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,530
and at

441
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,600
when I look at it again be edited values
have changed so basically

442
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,850
I can have an added double data
structure right in right in my notebook

443
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,789
right can make the data transformation
but I'm still doing

444
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,360
the visualization with normal code so I
can mix and match the things that a

445
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,789
better natural to do

446
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:22,030
with with hand in activity such as in in
a spreadsheet data manipulations but

447
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,700
leaving

448
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,440
the computational part 2 explicit code
which means I can unit test

449
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,809
that I can run against a validation
sweet I can we use it with other forms

450
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:32,650
of input if I if I want to

451
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,880
me we've actually gone

452
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,230
the this interaction between this
ability to to Iraq between between the

453
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,340
web browsing Dallas script and the back
and

454
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,070
is Argos fairly deep arm so this is

455
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,650
this is an example love riding a little
bit of code that uses the three

456
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,850
to simply fact arise a number and as its
factoring the number it sending data to

457
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,730
the d3

458
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,140
23 draft directive layout are and I can

459
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,909
I can say well if I want to spread
illustrated

460
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:08,809
I know 72 has a lot of factors so if I
want to illustrate how do

461
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:14,429
how to factors Asian work I can I can II
can run this it's sending data to the 2d

462
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:15,970
three ND 3z event handlers

463
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,039
are responding in real time to the
number to the pipe and colonel which is

464
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,059
sending a day da

465
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:24,700
are ended their updating we I don't have
call back in ten hammers wired in here

466
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,950
but the three could also send call backs
back and and made may be based on the

467
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,890
node you click

468
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,549
Omniture job done stop fact rise in that
particular branch or something

469
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:37,630
aren't so these are obviously toy
example but there there there there to

470
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,309
illustrate

471
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,080
that would really built an
infrastructure that lets us get

472
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,220
arm really why your back potentially

473
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,720
very sophisticated computational
services into into the

474
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,549
that the environment on the web browser
this happens to be running locally in my

475
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:52,279
laptop

476
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:56,190
but that code could be running on an
arbitrarily large are back and

477
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,700
that is attached to a huge data center
to a supercomputer and we've done that

478
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,909
on but that is still rendering in your
arm in your notebook

479
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:06,080
although this is based on a fairly
simple architecture the kernel

480
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,830
executes codes sends messages over 0 MQ
and clients listen to those messages

481
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,860
and as I said we ship a terminal a cutie
and a web console but people can write

482
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,919
other clients

483
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,510
and as we'll see a minute to they have
on but people have also written other

484
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,330
kernels

485
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,240
arm they've written kernels in many
languages now

486
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,510
arm in particular were excited about the
fact that we now have a colonel

487
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:33,070
in our arm and it's really great because
the Arcana lets you do things like this

488
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,710
so when we have in our kernel

489
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,130
this is now using pure are syntax this
is our sin taxes is not bite on cent tax

490
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,940
and its loading some let slowing the
library for mapping that is apparently

491
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,710
very popular in the art world

492
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,049
arm and so if you want to if you happen
to need to use pure are we have in our

493
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:52,159
kernel we have a pure Julia colonel

494
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,029
as a short in a previous life we aren't
we're now up to something like

495
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:00,659
up to something like eleven are well ten
functional ones

496
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:07,270
and yesterday somebody tweeted that arm
that they were working on an Erlang 1

497
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,900
arm this architecture this architecture
is based

498
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,900
arm candy expose not only not only as a
notebook

499
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,010
I'm you can create your own web services
so this is an example

500
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,039
on this is an example of a non notebook

501
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:26,610
looking in for in interface where I
although I still have a van handlers

502
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,510
but there's no ko to type all I have is
my own web service

503
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,020
that called back to a pipe and colonel
and reuse is 100 percent or code

504
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,559
bought presents a different web
interface so if you don't need a

505
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,419
notebook document style thing

506
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:41,549
but what you want is a web service that
attached to the back

507
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:44,059
you can just reuse the Dallas reply
reason you can reuse all the

508
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,080
communication protocol

509
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,350
machinery but you don't have to expose
it in our

510
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:55,350
in necessarily the same way if that
doesn't make sense in your application

511
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,929
and so around this arm with with this
infrastructure what we're seeing is an

512
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:07,919
ecosystem of tool growing

513
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,559
for us as I said obviously we are
scientists that's what pays the bills

514
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,010
so we're trying to use this to do better
research and to do research that is

515
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,080
reproducible this is an example of a
paper

516
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,529
we published last year this is one other
nature journals in in this case in

517
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:21,799
microbial ecology

518
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:24,620
and this was a collaboration with
biologists I'm not a biologist where we

519
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:24,960
did

520
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,710
some and we ran some code on Amazon
cluster arm paralyzing using iPad and

521
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,720
perilous economic analysis and in the
end one in one day

522
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,360
we were able to go from a serial script
that would've taken about a month to run

523
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,850
to our result that that's an afternoon
we called it the editor

524
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,070
other Center journal and asked if we
could submit a rapid communication paper

525
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,080
for for that because we had a we had a
publishable result by

526
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,669
by the end of the afternoon arm but what
we did was in addition to publishing a

527
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:51,309
paper which is as i said what pads

528
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:55,450
what pat's the CV's arm we actually try
to do something a little better which

529
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:55,890
was

530
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,909
to publish the virtual machine images
that we used

531
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,350
to do this work in this was following on
the on the steps of Titus brown I

532
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,580
notices in the room

533
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,620
who had already done this with one of
his papers which is due make available

534
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,929
the entirety of our computation

535
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:12,440
in the form on Amazon machine image so
all you have to do if you want to

536
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,080
replicate

537
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,230
our our work is to cart to copy that
config file that dictate that tells you

538
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,399
which Amazon machine image to
instantiate and then you can effectively

539
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:23,789
replicate exactly our competition and
then begin

540
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:27,520
exploring maybe the Bronner space ask if
we made an incorrect statistical

541
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,590
assumption at Satara

542
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,309
obviously you have to be your Amazon
bill but the machine images there with

543
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:33,010
all the code

544
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,159
are with all the current data to do it
and so we're trying to show that it

545
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,110
really is possible to do

546
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,419
to do computation that is battering and
communication about computing

547
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:45,690
that is more reproducible people are
using this for technical blogging

548
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,289
so this is an example J rendre plus War
II is also here he was teaching

549
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:50,140
yesterday

550
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,279
whose blog wow this is his blog

551
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,270
but his block which is a beautiful
Python blog every blog post he makes is

552
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,690
a pipe and notebook so if you want to
have a conversation

553
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,909
about something he's saying you don't
have to argue in a vacuum whether he did

554
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:04,370
something right or not even as good

555
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,450
basically download the blog post and run
it yourself and

556
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,940
having go down to the commenting section
and have a more have a more informed

557
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,750
discussion

558
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,990
arm and he's written a pelican plugin
make it very easy

559
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,940
on on my blog is also the same way we're
also seeing paper books not just papers

560
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,039
but entire books being published in this
way

561
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:25,610
so a colleague of ours was I don't think
a wrote a book on piping for signal

562
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,130
processing where the whole book

563
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,190
was created as notebooks and he
publishes not only the hard cover

564
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,390
expensive glossy paper Springer book

565
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,460
but also a gift Repole on get Hobbes
where you can download and execute the

566
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,210
entire

567
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,330
the entire book arm a Riley has a book
called mining the social web and I know

568
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,720
the author Matthew Russell was teaching
workshop here

569
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,649
the book was in written as notebooks but
it has a collection of notebooks for all

570
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:48,899
the examples in the book

571
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:51,230
so again you don't have to wonder
whether the other copy paste that the

572
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,380
right thing or whether they

573
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,620
change the script at the last minute and
that they did not think the book because

574
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,110
although the results are actually
execute a ble

575
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,190
arm in a lot of this is based on

576
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,740
isn't it takes advantage of a tool that
my PSP sonya was here in the room

577
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,610
wrote in 2012 cover notebook viewer in
which allows you to paste

578
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,320
if you want to give a notebook to
somebody and you want them to be able to

579
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,880
read it without installing anything

580
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,870
all you have to do is paste in here the
URL or the guest idea but notebook and

581
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,419
we will render it for you

582
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:25,690
so this is an example of a Julia
notebook if I click on that

583
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,620
what you see is this this is a web page
this is just my web browser I can't

584
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,340
execute anything here this is not

585
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,309
called this is just an HTML page but I
can go ahead and download if I click on

586
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:35,940
this

587
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,929
I will my browser will download that
notebook so we make sharing work as easy

588
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:40,260
as

589
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,480
put it somewhere online and send you
call it the URL they can view it as a

590
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,159
web page

591
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,500
and I believe they can read the analysis
it later they won executed that's fine

592
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,370
they can do that

593
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,549
but at least we make it very very easy
for them to see

594
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:54,470
what you're doing and we see traffic on
Twitter constantly where people are

595
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,149
sharing

596
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:58,539
their work in this way and I want to
take I

597
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:02,049
a case study that we saw happen last
week arm

598
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:06,640
up precisely based on this so 530 a dot
com which is Nate Solar's

599
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,899
new data-driven journalism gig published
arm published an article

600
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:16,049
about analysis arm humour gender in
movies gender and funding statistical

601
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:16,789
analysis of

602
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:19,779
on gender and funding in the Hollywood
industry and I'm going to discussing the

603
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:21,020
details of the article it's a

604
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,149
it's a darn what I wanna show is this
was what 538 published

605
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:30,279
on a couple weeks ago on so this is
actually the web but the 538 website

606
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:34,020
in an iframe in da Brian Keegan who is a
postdoc

607
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:39,230
at arm was a postdoc at Northwestern
here social scientist who does network

608
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,000
analysis said

609
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,029
when I wonder about those conclusions so
he went ahead and said

610
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:47,140
I'm going to replicate to that but I'm
gonna do it in the open

611
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,789
so he wrote this

612
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,649
and posted on get hard and posted a link
on and leave your to end a twenty year

613
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:55,330
which is

614
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,399
this incredibly detailed when we close
this down here

615
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:04,269
it's this incredibly detailed notebook
analyzing in replicating in critiquing

616
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:09,059
the results do repinned loading the data
scraping web sites

617
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:12,140
Chris creeping IMDB running all the code

618
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,360
doing statistical analysis it goes on
and on and on and on

619
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,440
and then you you have plots you have all
the kinks to its this extraordinarily

620
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,070
in-depth and detailed critique of 5 30
eights

621
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,299
analysis they hadn't published a code
right so he went in posted this notebook

622
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:33,429
and to their credit two days later 538
replied and i'm only quoting a short

623
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:35,360
excerpt of their reply day said

624
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,890
Keegan made a point 538 and similar
sites

625
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,539
should make their data available we
couldn't agree more and they put up

626
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,850
their code and data in their case it was
in our

627
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,799
on a repository and get hard so we're
seeing in this case a social scientist

628
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,360
basically saying

629
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,059
we can do this battle we can take the
mentality of the open source community

630
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,899
and public and make this stuff up openly
available and actually changing within

631
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,130
two days the behavior

632
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:06,130
on a side like 538 arm others are
building

633
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,990
many others are building a top I pipe on
both open source and commercial projects

634
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,409
and thought was a sad

635
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:19,960
has been a supporter love our since the
very beginning on they were the ones who

636
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,220
funded the work that let Brian tonight
to be able to create all this protocol

637
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,000
architecture

638
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,250
early on for their cannot project which
embeds I pipe on

639
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,630
on in a console here continue analytics

640
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,350
I which is also also here arm are so
hosts

641
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,929
a version of the notebook online so that
you can are without a without installing

642
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:40,740
anything you can go and use an online
it's called walküre it's basically an

643
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,700
embedded notebook

644
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,929
microsoftr the team into the team at
pipe and tools for Visual Studio from

645
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:46,779
Microsoft

646
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:50,490
arm just put out this is a screenshot
from a blog may post the two days ago

647
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,899
on with they had already a version that
integrated i buy them but they continue

648
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:56,309
to improve the integration between a
pipe on

649
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,639
and and the pipe and tools for Visual
Studio plugin and one interesting thing

650
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:00,580
about this is that

651
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,850
when we first met with them we only
showed them where the Qt console called

652
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,059
was in our report we never actually have
seen their code

653
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:11,010
all they saw was okay this is the man
this is the page that describes the

654
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,139
messaging protocol

655
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:15,549
and this is where the Qt Co does it okay
will take not Andino and

656
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:19,919
you know it's rock when home and on and
R&R year later they came back in there

657
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,659
was a above plugin for Visual Studio not
implemented

658
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:26,070
the particle may continue working on
that on the we've also worked with them

659
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,710
on making it very easy to deploy

660
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,750
on the is our cloud service man just on
Amazon arm if you are an Amazon there's

661
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,029
an open source project RMIT called star
cluster this is what we use for the

662
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:36,010
biology paper

663
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,260
that lets you spin up in a pipe in
parallel cluster with a notebook front

664
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,659
and

665
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,860
by just copying back and one one config
file basically are for star cluster two

666
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,740
beautiful open source but you don't have
to put

667
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,980
is there an ID because obviously have to
pay for the service are we saw last year

668
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,409
at SI pyaar great talk from the IBM
Watson team

669
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:56,130
now the people who did the job buddy
contest but the team that acquiesced

670
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:56,899
tasked with

671
00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:00,409
turning water into a product and this
scheme

672
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:05,919
are replaced an existing Hadoop Java
JavaScript d3 clunky infrastructure

673
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,530
that how to slow turnaround time because
it was all back she had duped and was

674
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,730
very complex the deploy

675
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,980
with an iPad and close running in
parallel and a notebook interface for

676
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,280
the engineers to login

677
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,819
and they went from about a thousand
lines a job I just emailed the three in

678
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:19,569
a complicated

679
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:24,369
deployment system to an interactive 070
deployment login

680
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:27,919
log in through the web browser right
writer code are

681
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,349
turnaround interactive time went from
two minutes 22 seconds because it's all

682
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,329
done in memory with the African pearl
stuff

683
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:36,770
and then when you're done you save and
use and you send a businessperson

684
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,819
just just the link to the notebook and
they can just you your report you're

685
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:42,760
done on this was again something that
the IBM Watson team did

686
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,050
without our involvement at all arm they
were just thought they were just

687
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,760
are they found they found are they found
the project in the use that arm and this

688
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,240
was in July a blaster and I was very
happy when I saw

689
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,089
in a in November that they turn it into
a that what is now like a 1.8 billion

690
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:57,109
dollar business unit

691
00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:00,400
at Microsoft so it's obviously something
that has been used for

692
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,490
for serious products arm a start up from
the mayor of writing go from Boston

693
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,030
Ubuntu bus services created an
environment for

694
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,760
riding collaboratively academic
publications on Google Docs style

695
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,910
but for really for academic writing
called of the Riyadh and that you can

696
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,740
write using my paper notebooks right

697
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,130
in right in the environment so you can
collaborate on lock textile academic

698
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,690
writing

699
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,040
using I pipe on on in the cloud thanks
to

700
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,579
arm thanks to the machine with these
guys have built another

701
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:31,579
up scientifically are oriented start-up
also

702
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:34,630
also there now in in Boston cop lightly

703
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,329
that lets you load their libros and plot
but it's actually

704
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:42,730
hosting the plots on their servers are
so that the code and out our available

705
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,450
there and you have %uh

706
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,359
you have a unique URL on for their for
their plots but this is all interactive

707
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,250
I think they're using

708
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,940
arm well actually I don't I don't
remember if they're using the three or

709
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,480
not but

710
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,960
when you run that code you get a plot
embedded into your but we know that how

711
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,260
to start a queue ID

712
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,180
referring to the current data that you
can share with others but it fully

713
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,500
integrates with a pipe on

714
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,790
and I and we've been would be no working
with them on

715
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,819
on this we also have a project for that
came out of our

716
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:12,020
University of Toronto and our don't want
to lead on the lease on this project

717
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,190
this year Tara charms from called nd def

718
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,480
he's been given to provide but again by
some for carpentry Greg Wilson

719
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,819
that lets you defend marriage notebooks
it regarded

720
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:24,690
these files are Jason data structures so
they're kind of a pain in the neck if

721
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,460
you defend

722
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,130
just withdraw text if they're horrible
so these guys are building a web service

723
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,890
to give you

724
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,010
kind of civilized structured dipping
emerging

725
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,690
I for these documents and saw this just
told me that I'm out of time

726
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,810
on but that's good because I I am
wrapping up

727
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,830
so I E II one can have

728
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:47,050
go back to to the 32 the two kinda main
directions one is that

729
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,040
pythons and so is very it was
interesting to see Brett can on the

730
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,140
first morning said that he came for the
language but he stayed for the community

731
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,260
because I look back

732
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,790
at my last slide up icon Canada in 2012

733
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,210
and I had that exact same quote two
years ago because that is it that is

734
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,589
also true for me I

735
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:05,080
I got sucked in when I was a grad
student looking for something to

736
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,270
procrastinate on

737
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:10,089
because the languages was awesome I I
had written on a pro coach for managing

738
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:11,020
my data

739
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,460
in a when I realized that 24 hours after
having read

740
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,930
just the python tutorial be at the
standard official one in in the docs

741
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,660
I could do in Python things that I
wasn't it's not a

742
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,390
didn't know how to do them in Pearl I
didn't know that were possible in Pearl

743
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,030
and and I had written it on a pro card
so I but when I said okay

744
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:32,540
this is what I'm doing armed but it's
easy to say that when you're at in

745
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,599
looking for something to do other than
finishing your dissertation it's harder

746
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,920
to keep dot as a career and what has
kept me in is the fantastic community

747
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,230
boat in our

748
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,920
Saipa a world which is an amazing crowd
and as larger

749
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,250
are open source piping to me that I've
come to but I've come to meet

750
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,080
arm on the iPod iPhone side I hope that
that have shown you that we've built

751
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,520
something that by having

752
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,349
open protocols and open formats is a
useful tool for computing in a very

753
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:58,330
broad sense

754
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,780
and it's not a scientifically oriented
only tool guess we build it because we

755
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,310
needed

756
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,490
but we hope it's a tool that can be
relevant to many have you and there's a

757
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,200
lot to contribute tonight by then
there's

758
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,359
many projects have been helping
obviously you should work on what really

759
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,730
interests you but if you want to work on
a paper there's plenty of room arm

760
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:18,060
and finally I wanna close by thanking
first of all we know for creating this

761
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,960
fantastic

762
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,710
a tool and for being open to
conversation like for spec for 65 which

763
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,180
is only the last one has been other

764
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,460
similar ones in the past and the entire
by 10 Def team arm and also to

765
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,609
Diana and a baller had nine o'clock and
a baller who have done an amazing job as

766
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:33,290
well as the

767
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:40,290
the local pipe on organ pipe on
organizing team thank you very very much

768
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,460
and I don't know

769
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,540
if fibers from I think we're out of time
and habitat questions

770
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,180
one or two now or out in the hall I'll
Bobby here for the rest the conference
