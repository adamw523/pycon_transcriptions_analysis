1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,650
now I well where we going to hear from
Salina de commande about how to

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,280
reach out to local teachers why should
and how to

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,380
this is a half-hour sessions will be 25
minutes than five minutes of questions

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,400
hopefully

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,400
so please welcome slain the fuck

6
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:26,060
okay so that Billy your are the slides

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,810
for this stock and I am linking to
hearing things if you wanna

8
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:35,239
grab those links as they go through your
welcome to have at that so

9
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,129
accuser is harping on this idea that we
need to connect with teachers and I see

10
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:43,550
teachers I mostly mean K through 12
teachers just to set

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,649
a little contacts for i'm talking about.
and I am

12
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,750
as I was thinking about you know how

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,010
I came to decide that I really wanted

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,820
more k to 12 teachers in my life I
wanted to get help from them

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,929
in the kind of teaching and I was doing
for pilot is which is mostly about

16
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:06,670
teaching adults I realize that this was
kind of how I thought about

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,380
this problem initially and basically

18
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,610
I thought as you know kids coming from
parents

19
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,730
which seems normal natural gas and

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:22,730
hidden and then the series it influences
you know you got the family the society

21
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,370
the piers the teachers

22
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,900
and then and then the school and then
out at the other end magically a Python

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,430
programmers pop out right

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,880
it this is kinda how how I really a

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,570
thought about things for a long time and
I am I mean it

26
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,020
like most the talk today is gonna be
about these a

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,580
leaky parts this pipeline is

28
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,150
assumptions and ideas the people

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,260
end up that end up becoming ingrained

30
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,610
at Lake math makes me anxious that one

31
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,730
that one so it's pretty early and other
one is that computer science is boring

32
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,600
and irrelevant and that has a pretty
significant impact on whether or not

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,970
people ever decide to try to learn how
to program

34
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,190
another one is that computer sciences
for white boys and there's

35
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,010
quite a bit research that's been done in
the last like tender

36
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,430
you know twenty years about this issue

37
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,030
and finally and there's a specific issue
that affects

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,900
Python which is that people believe that
there aren't any jobs and Foss

39
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,110
and that probably will come as a
surprise to her people who room cuz a

40
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,800
lot of us

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,190
are employed you know to write Python
for living

42
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,730
but there are a lot of people that
believe that that's just not possible so

43
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,110
I'm but this really only addresses that
point which at which you know people are

44
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,990
in school or they get outta school

45
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,010
and really there's a lot more to this
problem

46
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,230
not only can address all that but i just
want to point out that there sir this

47
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,000
bigger

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,310
donate out the hair a fish use involving

49
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,920
people I getting into an hour as the
computer science

50
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,680
and industry and

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,130
the thing but i wanna when you put the
head to head

52
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,930
good thing is that it's pretty leaky but
but the big

53
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,590
fundamentally believe about the leaky
down at is my head

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,790
I'm is that you know

55
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,100
it does leak n people the exit

56
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,750
our industry at quite an alarming great
but

57
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,020
an the work that I'm doing and if you
were here for the encoders are shut the

58
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,650
work that folks like barbara and

59
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,709
Katie you're doing so many people doing
wonderful work with kids and adults

60
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:32,209
right now

61
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,880
trying to get people back into the don't
and

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,200
and that's kinda what this stock is
really about you know Lake

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,280
people might encounter some movies you
know

64
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,459
these assumptions and thoughts and ideas

65
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,940
but there are things that we can all do
to combat it

66
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,720
so am say at Sony we don't

67
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,849
and and brings me to you sir the

68
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,860
meta issue that I encounter quite a bit

69
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,030
in teaching adults which is a

70
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,370
I've come to kinda think of this as the
possibilities problem

71
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,410
and there's this really a

72
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,950
affecting blog posts that

73
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,529
Julia for math wrote about a year ago
and it's about women in TAC

74
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,669
about her experience and she said this
thing that just really

75
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:24,669
kinda stopped me in my tracks when I
read it which

76
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,460
was you know I didn't grow up thinking I
could do anything I wanted to

77
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,259
and at every time I hear his head just
you I feel really overwhelmed because

78
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,879
it's so matches what I experience

79
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,919
win I go into workshops

80
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,969
in teach women to learn how to code for
the first time

81
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:48,199
I'm in this this is a picture we talkin
workshop teaching

82
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,509
adults about algorithms and they were
doing a pen and pencil exercise you know

83
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,180
trying to figure out how to get from the
airport to home

84
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,620
using about a different transportation
methods an

85
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,819
but as they were going to you that what
they said afterward was

86
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:07,839
that they finally felt confident that
they could explain what an algorithm was

87
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,419
the before the econ they'd never really
thought about what it what

88
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,969
an hour then was and also how that
related to programming in any way

89
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:18,589
and what it might mean to create their
own algorithms

90
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:22,479
and thats that's really powerful
transformation

91
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,749
for them so

92
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:29,770
here's now to go into all the reasons
why I think

93
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,089
case usual teachers in particular are

94
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:36,909
a a place where we can a fact

95
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:40,129
culture change at a pretty massive scale

96
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:44,259
an you know the Younkers worship I think
is a great example are doing this we're

97
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:48,759
we're just going out there and directly
interacting with kids and showing them

98
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,939
what's possible and if it's a wonderful
thing and I wish that we could do it

99
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:55,240
everywhere all the time and the great
thing about

100
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,849
public education United States and let
my comments really are gonna be about

101
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:02,240
a the United States there's lots of
interesting stuff for example going on

102
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,419
India right now

103
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,020
where live just introduce Python as a as
a

104
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,849
language that can be tight an at the
recital centre John a.m.

105
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:13,819
there's great so happy in other
countries that must make an essay will

106
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,529
be shipped to the United States

107
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,919
anyway if we could get more case Utah
teachers a

108
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,240
doing computer science doing competition
literacy I think it will change

109
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,729
a lot for us so when the fundamental
problems that we face

110
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:31,229
with kids is that they think math

111
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,379
just I mean nothing I think math just
makes them anxious

112
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,029
and there are a couple reasons am
there's some fundamental reasons

113
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:42,509
why this happens so early and one of
them

114
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:45,610
is timed math tests

115
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,270
and this starts as early as the first
grade there's research about

116
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,439
first-graders

117
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:53,439
and this particular study am was

118
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,990
there was an article that was published
at this month

119
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,300
2014 and this is a comment from a
second-grader

120
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,499
after taking a timed test this is what
they said I'm

121
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:07,699
I'm terrible at math and win

122
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,469
the when it starts that early it just
you know it kinda snowballs

123
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:17,349
a so whenever the things that would be
very helpful

124
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:21,259
for teachers at that level is to have
less pressure

125
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,259
to have these timed tests have these
performance

126
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:28,629
measurements have you know maps at such
an early age

127
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:31,680
because really what we want to be doing
at that point is exploring

128
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,529
and helping kids understand the beauty
and the art that is there

129
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:39,629
in math a much less than having to
perform

130
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,649
that they can add or multiply or
subtract whatever

131
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:46,689
in strictly time environment and let's
create

132
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:50,179
is that like a an initial Baylor

133
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:54,569
at you know she and many other people
are saying to publish now

134
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:58,099
peer-reviewed research that demonstrates
how

135
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,659
we can teach math in a way that doesn't
increase math anxiety

136
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:05,029
and I I have a link there if you're
interested in that

137
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:09,599
in reading that city in seeing what they
have to say about that

138
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,029
another attitude it out there am pretty
early

139
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:17,129
with kids you know probably love the
rich city is like

140
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,279
for six crater top-grade and the
computer science is boring

141
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,539
her irrelevant to their lives and

142
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:29,419
and a problem with that attitude is the
head ninety-eight percent of computer

143
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:33,300
science majors are exposed in some way
to computer science before

144
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,669
college so if kids think that it's
irrelevant

145
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,519
to them that early they probably are not
going to become computer science

146
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,120
majors because they just won't ever
bother to take any other classes

147
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,470
and then the other compounding
unfortunate thing is that

148
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,970
also most women who get computer science
degrees are exposed to it before college

149
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,009
into going to give you a sense of the
scale love

150
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:01,610
what we're up against here in 2012

151
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,160
about 25,000 students took the AP
Computer Science

152
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,449
class which is no respectable number and
it was actually

153
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:13,690
a almost a 15 percent increase over the
number that to get in 2011

154
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,329
but unfortunately when you can hear it
in

155
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:22,509
the number I love tests taken for AP
Calculus which he knows like

156
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:26,430
EF two usually take four years a mass in
the United States to get to the point

157
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,990
where you'd be ready for an AP Calculus
test

158
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,380
are you can see that we're working
against some pretty significant

159
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,670
and numbers there there's not a lot of
kids that are taking an AP

160
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,620
a computer science test so we're
starting way behind

161
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,699
am so is our lineup I lease and

162
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:48,930
you know I like I said I'm I mostly
teaching adults but I i think that

163
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,170
hi ladies is relevant because for a
number of reasons

164
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,889
and one of them is this attitude which
is also fairly prevalent

165
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:01,160
am and discuss quite a bit in unlocking
the clubhouse

166
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,180
and stuck in the shallow and and there's
a woman jay margolis who's done a great

167
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,970
deal of research into this person really
great

168
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,120
short readable books about her research
into this thinking can explain the

169
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,240
reasons why

170
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,199
kids think that computer science in the
United States is only for white boys

171
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:21,870
and and the impacted that which love you
probably heard

172
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,860
something like this and you probably
also heard that in free and open source

173
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,389
%uh for there's only maybe

174
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:29,639
you know 12 or 3 percent are women

175
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,230
a so but the the compounding factor here
the

176
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,509
bill leaky donut factor is that ten
years and only 58 percent of women

177
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,589
choose to stay in the industry well
eighty-five percent of men do

178
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,290
so I think the pie ladies is another
compounding

179
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,339
important and effort to try to keep

180
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,500
women in our industry if they managed to

181
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,009
to get there in the first place

182
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,230
so the last scan a a

183
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,680
school-related you know K to 12 related
issue that I wanna talk about

184
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,490
am 22 hopefully motivate you to go out
there and get in touch with teachers is

185
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,040
that

186
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,160
this idea that there are no jobs in free
and open source software

187
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,329
so you might get all the way through
decide the computer science is fun and

188
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,149
exciting in its for you

189
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,250
but then in the end you like our well
I'm never going to get a job anyway so I

190
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,660
probably shouldn't

191
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,839
finish my degree at so there's actually
some research

192
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,139
into these kinds about it is I'm a lot
of them are really specific to

193
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,589
it. you know so kinda the beer broader
IT industry

194
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,810
a as opposed to freedom cancer suffer
but they are

195
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,040
very related attitudes I think and this
this set every search was

196
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,600
an a survey about 6,000 students in five
different European countries

197
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,660
in a lot of instances what they found
was that the teachers and the parents

198
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,329
both

199
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:54,079
really poorly educated about what the
opportunities where they just really had

200
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,879
no idea what these jobs

201
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,930
we're like and one attitude that i think
is particularly relevant to free and

202
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,029
open source software is this idea

203
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,600
that the IT jobs are there to help
people

204
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,319
so who only fifty-five percent and own
up girls and only forty percent of

205
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,389
parents and teachers believed

206
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:18,329
that IT jobs were gonna help people
improve the world in any way

207
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:22,300
and that's really sad right leg is him
cuts what a lot of us is not not

208
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,360
everyone of course but a lot of us in
this room that's why

209
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,509
that's what motivated us to get involved
in free and open source %uh for in the

210
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:29,259
first place

211
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:32,649
because we thought we were gonna make an
impact on the world and change things

212
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:35,970
for the better an you know teachers and
parents like

213
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,029
a really have no idea that that's the
case which is

214
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:43,029
which is too bad so is my belief that

215
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,589
to you effectively change this you know
it is it's the culture problem

216
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:50,639
and it so much wider will hold the issue

217
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,339
I'm to do it I think that we have to
intervene at a lot of different ages

218
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,470
a lot of different for her stages at
also shown up socio-economic

219
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,750
levels an i think is possible to do that

220
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,980
with teachers because they span a lot of
those barriers in come in contact with

221
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,740
parents

222
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,199
and kids in a way that you know at least
for me for my part

223
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,170
you know I were from Oslo and coming
from a pit places extreme for religion

224
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,310
an awesome air-conditioned office that I
get to go to every day

225
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,120
and I don't come in contact with a lot
of the people that might believe that

226
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,660
there were no jobs

227
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,790
in free and open source software every
day but

228
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,870
teachers certainly do

229
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,069
so I've done a bunch of other computer
science and education topics in II link

230
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:34,829
to them here to welcome the CNA

231
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,889
going to a lot of detail about Common
Core

232
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:41,680
about an you know the state as computer
science

233
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,189
an education in the US there's lot agree
information out there from

234
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:49,499
the ACM from the computer sciences
Association stuff like that you can

235
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:49,949
check

236
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:52,970
all that stuff out there if you're
interested in

237
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,029
that and and now I'm just gonna go into
some very practical things that I think

238
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,480
that we all can do right away to get
involved

239
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,100
a with more teachers I think you're
really amazing model for advocacy

240
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,110
an comes from Dina perot a

241
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,240
the programs called ir been teen and
there's a link later to the website for

242
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,040
at

243
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,870
is me and basically with this program

244
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:23,529
does is it for it focuses on
african-american and Latino kids

245
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,680
bringing them in and exposing them to
programming for the first time

246
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,060
a.m. the the big innovation their

247
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,199
firm from her is she brings the parents
in the kids together

248
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,240
at the same time and then once they can
I come to this

249
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,290
day-long workshop on weekend she split
them up she takes the parents of in a

250
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,199
one-room

251
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,139
and they get to talk to a venture you
know it. exact super members or whatever

252
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:48,009
about

253
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:51,509
the curtain dusty to the industry the
fact that

254
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:55,649
a IT jobs are not in fact being halsell
outsourced

255
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:59,100
outside the United States or in Canada
right now that anyway

256
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,139
and this is that this is a very
prevalent

257
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,689
a idea a mess in the United States you
can't find an IT job

258
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:10,829
and it seems very strange to me because
man like we can hire fasten a friend

259
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,160
like we can train people pass in after

260
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,649
to hire them but you know there's still
a lot of people that believe that their

261
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,800
jobs are out there

262
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,879
so she suffers aside get them to talk
with industry leaders about the save it

263
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,180
and then takes the kids

264
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,230
in another room and a show some cool
stuff you know

265
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,949
does demos you know please robots you
know cool cool things that the

266
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,149
the kids be into and the

267
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:36,149
great thing about this program is that
75 percent the kids who have attended

268
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,829
these have seen involved in programming
in some way

269
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:41,889
the supreme dramatic impact in a in a

270
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:45,490
really important community

271
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,459
and another thing that I think we have a
big impact is teaching computational

272
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,100
thinking

273
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,730
to all ages and people

274
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,410
and if you've heard this before am to
net wing is kinda

275
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,389
seems like the mother above the current
computational thinking movement this is

276
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,399
a big long

277
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,470
thing and parishioners but the slain he
remembered I a summarized it

278
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,559
I'm which and how how I think it is as

279
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,809
its humans harnessing algorithms and
automation to solve problems make lives

280
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:15,959
easier

281
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,199
make the world better and you know it's
really focusing on algorithms and

282
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:24,600
on a mission peace and how humans
interact with machines as opposed to

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,309
just

284
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:29,019
them as opposed to just I'm thinking
about it in terms ove

285
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:33,370
map their programming there's a great
set of curriculum called

286
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,209
CS unplugged on org the helps that gives
lessons

287
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:40,290
for how to teach computational thinking
without using computers

288
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,509
on is also talk from the CS Educare
sorry from the

289
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:47,180
the Python education summit they just
happen as me a retard

290
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,329
on how to teach compositional think
using Python agree resources out there

291
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:56,089
and this is something that I think he'd
be really great if we all would teach

292
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:57,559
her family its

293
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:02,220
a hunch besides on a little earlier but
I I mean I don't know you but my family

294
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,520
doesn't really know what I'd do

295
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:10,290
naked I'm I'm actually for a living I
work on databases you know I came amid a

296
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,430
target act in a in a rate allotted

297
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,520
sequel and design data structures and
data stores like that

298
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,720
and a if I could teach my parents

299
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,140
just a little bit more about what it is
they do and my brother and sister for

300
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,000
that matter

301
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,590
and it and I we probably have a lot more
interesting Christmas conversations

302
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,870
hmm am

303
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,870
so at so those are kinda like the other

304
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,710
other two things work I like these men
ideas and went 1 direct action thing you

305
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,850
can do is find a local teacher

306
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,920
and fortunately & Co .org

307
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,860
has put together a wonderful resource in
the United States I think that there is

308
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,030
some information outside the US to in

309
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,500
in the US it's really great so if you
put in your city and state

310
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,090
at this your you'll get a list love
local

311
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,860
high schools and has middle schools and
his own entry schools that have

312
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,700
after school programs have are teaching
cs4 on CS classes

313
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,220
like in my community I found out that
and this one teacher Chris partner had

314
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,790
a four year computer science program in
this high school which is just amazing

315
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,900
spree and her death and in the US at

316
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,130
but anyway I i ended up meeting am a
different teachers

317
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,280
this way and a it's it's just a
fantastic resource and you can contact

318
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,910
his contact information

319
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,030
for the schools they renew and the way
that I did it and I

320
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,260
a air in previous oxo done on this

321
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,620
have like a template email your welcome
just a copy

322
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,450
and plug in your own information

323
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,070
and see if you can get a teacher to
respond to you and almost every

324
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,910
teacher that I contacted sent me an
email back and one meter

325
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,770
company with them which was just
wonderful

326
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,000
and then one thing that you can offer to
teachers

327
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,230
that's that they tend to want is for you
just to talk about your jobs the

328
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,360
classroom

329
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,460
its super relevant to the kids they
don't often get a lot of contacts and

330
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:06,940
must

331
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,830
you know they have apparent that's
already in the industry with people or

332
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,050
who are currently in the industry and
they love to hear about what is it you

333
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,380
do

334
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,080
of course he kinda gotta make your
presentation age-appropriate

335
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,940
that I am when I tend to use just are
not talking about a problem that I saw

336
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,840
them I work

337
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,690
and for me this is you know the most
basic level how I describe it is that

338
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,630
sometimes Firefox crashes

339
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,390
right and her almost everybody in the
room can relate to Pisa suffer crashing

340
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,400
on them

341
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,200
and you can I I tell the kids that I try
to help figure out

342
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,590
why that happens and then help other
people

343
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,630
make Firefox Firefox crashed less next
time

344
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,080
and here's how and then I can show them
either you know the variety of tools

345
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,350
that I use now I get to show them you
know a

346
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,510
Firefox phone crashing an

347
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,210
and others like hell also serve neat
stuff they can be there

348
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:03,210
Anna to help kids understand what it's
like to work in the industry

349
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:08,300
another great thing to do an is have a
look at the after school programs that

350
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,370
are out there

351
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,840
and the Computer Science Teachers
Association is a great resource for this

352
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,530
and there are local chapters I know that
I don't think barbour's

353
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:24,100
here bet she's she's got involved in her
local chapter in Austin Texas

354
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,490
and most most major cities have a local
chapter at this point

355
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,600
I'm your local tech Association might be
an option so an organ we have the Texas

356
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,000
Association workin in a very active in
Portland

357
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,350
opportunity with the teachers and
there's also just industry affiliates

358
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,790
so my my first job at a college was at
Intel and they were

359
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:46,440
an deeply involved in mentoring kids at
the local high schools

360
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,890
so often the larger companies will have
the structured mentoring programs and

361
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,560
it's actually usually not too hard to
get involved

362
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,590
in those even if you don't work for that
jane to a company

363
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,820
as a civilian organ here's three
programs that am I've

364
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,160
had some contact with her had friends
participate in

365
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,390
and you can you know officially they're
there there aren't a lot of Lake

366
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,110
big-name programs like in the UK there
are some by the United States there

367
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,300
aren't as many that I've come across

368
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,380
but Inori in we've got these three that
are really great and they are always

369
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,300
looking for volunteers

370
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,860
another thing people might be certain
interested in is lobbying am

371
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,400
and could argue again mike has some
great starter resources here

372
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,900
and you can check that out at at could
or promote and

373
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,290
the Computer Science Teachers
Association also has like a good

374
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,740
a vast array have resources related to

375
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,310
lobbying it's a little harder to come to
crack into you bet just starting with

376
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,070
their

377
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,620
research papers and i'm looking at their
suggested actions in this research

378
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,970
papers is a great way

379
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,680
to get involved in that

380
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,780
another thing people sir to forget about
his professional development for

381
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,960
teachers

382
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,350
a so I I had the privileges going in
actually key noting the Computer Science

383
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,360
Teachers Association last year

384
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,960
I was mean and like the gangster kirdar
code are which is

385
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,620
completely surreal experience but I I
guess talk about open source in

386
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,730
you know how I really wish that there
were more

387
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,550
a open source people in contact with
teachers can same through FEMA's

388
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:21,290
talking about today at but one thing
that teacher after teacher asked me as I

389
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,200
like so I wanna teach a class

390
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,580
that uses Python so what's the cool like
set of tools

391
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,110
that I should give to these kids you
know and so I gave

392
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,220
I gave a relationship just as a quality
you know get together flask late teaches

393
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,100
kids how to deploy something on her ok
you will be super stoked you know I know

394
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,850
how I can website and everything

395
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,070
but I am the teachers really would love
to have somebody coming give them

396
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,810
you know a tutorial on how to do that I
mean you can offer that and there are

397
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,160
professional development opportunities
mostly during the summertime

398
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,920
at you can after that's the school go in
for a day

399
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,710
and just like you know give give them
give them some ideas

400
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,410
for for teaching the kids or just you
know for their own

401
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,880
for their own edification

402
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,340
and finally am I really hit I really
wanna say teaching adults

403
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,910
I'm has completely changed my life like
I love it a

404
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,110
and be involved in pilot is is is by far
I

405
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,090
mean I I like fun it's great a bit be
involved in polly's is

406
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,450
is really when my favorite parts the
potentially

407
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,310
and I am and with adults you learn so
much some

408
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,210
so many things that you can share with
at your new teacher friends that you can

409
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,120
find

410
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,890
and I think it really helps improve this
first time entry

411
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,030
experience that people how the screen
open source software

412
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,950
and there's a lot of opportunities that
police forces all these workshops

413
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,110
a lot of times libraries will have
programs like the Monona County Library

414
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,660
where I'm at

415
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,310
has a thing called cyber seniors and you
can also do studio where shops

416
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,990
unjustified

417
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,330
invite if your friends so there's my
list

418
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,710
have stuff to do and her husband

419
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,910
I'm I'm happy I I've done actually done
most of these things to use i'm happy to

420
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,000
answer questions about like specific
things if you have any

421
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,460
and I just wanna close with am you know
I

422
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,290
I really think bill local connections
being in touch with your local community

423
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,240
are the way that we change

424
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,840
the larger culture and like I said you
can find

425
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,620
a this wonderful resources local
teachers just by going

426
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,070
to code are you in searching for your
city so I hope you'll do that

427
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:33,070
and thank you very much for listening

428
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,050
okay we do have five minutes for
questions so if you'd like to go to the

429
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:45,050
microphone please

430
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,120
it's just over hidden that's where back
here

431
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,860
in the back bunny I miss madame from
Seattle

432
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,250
and I'm kinda stuck on how the local I'm
middle school and high school in my area

433
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,660
are stuck on scratch and BYOB and other
kinda graphical

434
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,090
tools to teach that way when there'd

435
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,480
they're not making the leap into having
kids actually cut code I wonder

436
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,620
you have an opinion on whether that's
that's that can be as effective or for

437
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,450
really missing something by not teaching

438
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,360
his trucks

439
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,760
you know it that's a good question I
mean

440
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,630
it certainly is a barrier if they want
to rape eitan

441
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,790
rain X crashes in doesn't really

442
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,030
help you too much mean it the

443
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,040
the more important thing the most
important thing from

444
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,840
lake and long-term perspective is that
they get comfortable

445
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,110
with the idea of creating things that

446
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,360
they share use and and for themselves
like that

447
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,230
active creation is the most important
thing and i've seen

448
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,770
a lot of scratch programs that get kids
so point where they

449
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,080
are super excited about getting on a
computer

450
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,950
scream around that breaking things and
being okay with that and and

451
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,860
if it breaks down that anxiety I think
it's great

452
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,570
but yeah I mean as far as like promoting
the type of programming that's gonna get

453
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,690
you into

454
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,280
a computer science for anthony gets you
in the industry

455
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,290
yeah I don't know I don't know scratch
on its own

456
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,340
without the second kinda level

457
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:26,340
really really does that I don't I'm
seeing evidence it does anyway

458
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,910
hi I'm so I love what youve been

459
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,450
this Canon open in question a lot of
what you've been talking about has been

460
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,730
focus more on an urban context like I i
grew up in borderline berle

461
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,770
men of county North Carolina like I
think back when I was

462
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,470
I mean I only got into programming
because my dad used to run a BBS back in

463
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,140
the day

464
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,370
the giant like that the in like when I
was learning Python

465
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,820
I was pretty sure that I was the only
person in Randolph County who knew a

466
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,100
Python that lets

467
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,200
I white you probably hear yeah

468
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,670
so I guess the question is like how do
you

469
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,000
work how can you do this sort of thing
in

470
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,450
I kinda rural are borderline rural
environment like that where there's not

471
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,710
really much irv

472
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,370
attack industry or tech people to you I
guess help

473
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,100
now to question so I grew up in montana
and now no nowhere

474
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,320
and I was lucky enough to have
grandfather who is a TV repairman

475
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,110
and and ham operator aunt and uncle

476
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:33,360
that was really into hobbyists computer
assembly so I'm probably not the best

477
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,800
it so i'm not i'm not am

478
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,770
I'm trying every qualified to to talk
about

479
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,500
that sort of thing that what I what I
will say about the experience and

480
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,780
Montano was that the

481
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,540
the important thing was having a place
am

482
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,080
and it was just because the resources
were so scarce in the kids didn't have

483
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,370
computers in their homes

484
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,700
and this is kind of changing I think you
know I think it's much more likely than

485
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,750
a kid's gonna have

486
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,060
access to some kind of computer in the
home

487
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,940
but for you know the kids are in my high
school Muslim didn't

488
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,480
as so we had a computer lab and and we
had

489
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,490
teachers and parents %uh volunteered to
staff that lab after school

490
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,750
and out and that and now is how the

491
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,440
you know I was imparted that I was like
all that scary you know like I was an

492
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,760
intern at my high school

493
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,320
I really didn't get on the computer
anything and I was in college

494
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,900
but for the kids that were into it and
the teachers and the parents try to

495
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,580
place

496
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,450
I N that was what enabled them to

497
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,500
figure anything out you know so

498
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,210
yeah thats is as much expertise is I
have

499
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,550
in that area I think I think definitely
for kids under

500
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,700
in rural areas being able to access like
wider

501
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,450
resources really important and there are
some things like the Florida Virtual

502
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,080
School

503
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,030
is prolly to you big firms for virtual
school being one the other 1 I'm

504
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,360
like is slipping my mind at the moment
but you can a

505
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,030
take online classes there for credit an

506
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,200
that are recognized in a lot of states
not all states that a lot of states

507
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,880
recognize that for credit and kids can
get access to

508
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,080
am coursework early on that way thank
you

509
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,470
yet me my name's

510
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,820
Elliott intricate and I was wondering if
there's anything that you think is a

511
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,870
glaring

512
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,230
an a hole that we as a community can
build

513
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,540
curriculum are tools I am I've wet you
know

514
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,310
has no start to think about is like the
teaching stack like what you need

515
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,410
as a teacher you reach out to local
teacher what can you give them

516
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:40,060
as far as resources are tolsey is yeah I

517
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,150
it's really contest dependent am at Lake
at

518
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,710
I feel like in a little a little way
used service Lake gave me like the most

519
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,620
awesome like set up there for

520
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,240
that because I have I this idea that we
should have

521
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,310
a teaching section the Python dork
website

522
00:29:55,310 --> 00:30:00,330
and an I don't wanna college education
think I wanna call it teaching

523
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,990
and I wanna find a way as getting case
you tell teachers and and and university

524
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,200
professors like that to that that
material in kinda put together

525
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,610
a set of resources a but anyway

526
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,860
like so that's one aspect of it and as
far as like the tooling is I think it

527
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,280
really depends on the resources that the
school tends to have

528
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,620
on so unfortunately much like

529
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,900
in a way that the pilot is workshops
really have to tailor

530
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,540
all their material to what the local
community

531
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,510
am is able to bring to the workshop I
think I think it's a minor you can have

532
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,430
to look at what the school has access to
get some schools they have like

533
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:40,170
ass unlikely next recisions others you
know they've got like windows

534
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,240
ninety-five pic

535
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,550
there's I mean it's it's pretty diverse
and difficult

536
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,920
environment out there so I would say
have a look at what they've got

537
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,140
and then you know see if cvp and create

538
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,770
and either VM's or you know a package
installer

539
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,310
and then and then blog about it so that
other people know that you made it

540
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,590
there are bottom efforts right now to
create

541
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:07,620
packages that work more universally this
is a huge problem for the workshop

542
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,920
goods the installers arm you know pip
install whatever

543
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:17,080
scanner sketchy a and you know the more
documentation that we build up about it

544
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,360
the better the installers will get I'm

545
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,500
I'm a for mile at I'm afraid we do have
ticked call time now

546
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,670
so could we please thanks Lena tearing a

547
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,130
thank you
