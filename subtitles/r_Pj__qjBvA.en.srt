1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:07,020
time make sure my clickers working here
alright

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,299
an so I'm terrain as you mention I'm the
cloud security product manager at space

3
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:17,789
asa my job is to basically build
products that our customers meet

4
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,789
at are used to be very security needs
his partner configurations

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,010
and i'm paul caron I'm I saw for
developer on park and which is a key

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,390
management service for OpenStack

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,449
and in my spare time I unfortunately do
a lot of crypto

8
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,960
me happen so well today we're going to
talk about the the state a Kryptonite on

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,440
sale

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,989
we put this talkin months months months
ago

11
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,530
and account since that point we've
actually been working on a lab rat will

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,379
talk about tonight the kinda does little
bit have

13
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,660
trying to solve this problem and bites
the running joke in our

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,660
our community is organised libraries
that it's basically at library created

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,289
by people who make poor life choices

16
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:55,039
akers working in crypto is something
else for sure

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,300
Selanne and kinda get started 10 things
you want to talk about a little bit as

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,809
well you know what we actually want

19
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,199
out love a crypto library I don't know
why the want is no longer on the slide

20
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,000
but or pretend that it's there an so as
to what outlook

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,060
at am at the crib to libraries weather
products that I'm working on a rack

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,100
space is a protocol barber can't it's a
a key management service

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,729
for OpenStack which is an open source
cloud platform am in so 10 things we're

24
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,270
looking as well we're going to do a lot
of

25
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,820
crypto working mark and so we need to
really understand what the crypto and

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,330
kind of

27
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,140
landscape is and pipe on because
everything in up its act in Python as we

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,350
really want out there looks are what we
what we wanted a crypto library

29
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,299
and so the first thing we want to be
able to do was to make sure that we have

30
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,229
the standards that algorithms that we
need

31
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,710
right and so what are you reading
library for other people going to use

32
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,159
that are reported to be open source

33
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,850
Kansas in the knees in our ability to
make sure that all the standard

34
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,189
libraries are available

35
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,979
i'm for you know whatever use cases that
your customers want

36
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,780
in addition that we want to make sure
that was open source right so everything

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,189
that and that is an open tax patchy do
everything that we work on not

38
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,030
everything a rack space but most things
at work on a rack space or open source

39
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,140
and ends from a security standpoint you
know

40
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,450
it's always a little bit better if the
code is open source and you can have

41
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,600
access to it you take leaps off on it
yourself

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,539
competition what's going on and we want
to have a pretty wide variety of

43
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:14,140
a python sport right so we didn't want
something that was locked 227

44
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,720
we wanted to be able to do by three we
want to be able to do Pai Pai and some

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,989
the various options that are out there

46
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,290
and finally we wanted something that was
maintained

47
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,129
ends strongly test and 10 things that
would notice in a lot of papon

48
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:29,970
options that are out there now is that
there are kinda varying levels above

49
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,870
both those things

50
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,050
I'm is a really what we're looking for
in the grand scheme of things is

51
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,500
a consolation %uh features for these
libraries that make something that we

52
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,200
could build on for a long period of time

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,030
right crypto code is not something you
want to go in and screw with on a

54
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,840
day-to-day basis

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,910
am into something that we could go in
and build something on a provide

56
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,530
other people that would rely on for a
while discuss something that we were

57
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,080
looking for

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,420
sale we want to look at at what was out
there

59
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,680
right so we lifted you know open SSL and
boat and crew plus plus

60
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,319
and the crypto API and an assassin
coming crypto Angie crypt in porous is

61
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,459
Alan all these libraries that are out
there i mean they're just

62
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,730
doesn't does libraries the people put
together and one thing you notice about

63
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,500
all these

64
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,580
is dead they're all written in C right
am

65
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,870
and Sue why is that really the case and

66
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,450
for those of you who probably already
know the answer this its that see allows

67
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,330
love low-level control that you cannot
get with me as languages such as Python

68
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,870
are specifically there are things like
timing in memory attacks on

69
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,590
uninitialized memory I is but the timing
is actually wanted most extensive

70
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,530
problems on

71
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,200
when you do things in crypto it's very
important to do things constant I'm

72
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,170
that means if you succeed if you fail
what kinda bite you just processed all

73
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,099
those things need to be

74
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,239
that they should be relevant from the
standpoint of the amount of time and

75
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,030
ideally the man to power consumed by the
process

76
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,250
are so those are things that
unfortunately Python for all its

77
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,689
wonderful part parts cannot offer us
right now on

78
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,519
we obviously would like to have existing
code I'm well obviously we just talked

79
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,239
about that and

80
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,590
it turns out to be an extensive amount
of existing code in crypto

81
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,239
whether or not its goodwill you guys can
draw your own conclusions for the moment

82
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:05,930
but I'm

83
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,000
it is exists on review code

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,569
a now again some the more recent things
might imply that the reviews are in

85
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,980
maybe not as good as they should be over
in the seaside

86
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,930
but in general these projects have seen
a lot of views

87
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,590
most of their code is well reviewed
maybe not so much in the Taylors

88
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,669
extension component

89
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,759
but in general I and you can try largely
trusted especially I

90
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,110
obstetric primitives with things like I
did

91
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,360
GCM allows you to do that by low-level
behaviors using actual hardware

92
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,190
extensions to guarantee constant I'm

93
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,690
so these are things that have been
developed over a longer time her very

94
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,639
reliable

95
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,020
on in the future there are there are
some interesting languages that are very

96
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,630
fast like Rustin go that may have

97
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,389
in some ways it to get away from C but
the moment if you wanna fight then the

98
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,169
only game in town to see

99
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,740
think we managed to make it about a
minute half before we made open as

100
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,449
objects

101
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:01,530
pretty and it's better than I thought
Springett

102
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,139
alright so we kinda went what did at the
major libraries in series we were gonna

103
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,690
look at all on there are dozens and
dozens and dozens and dozens but we

104
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,340
decided to try to pick what we thought
was a reasonable sample of what people

105
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,300
actually use

106
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,410
rights open SSL zombies the king daddy
that's you know that the most common

107
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,449
that you see it

108
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,560
that's the most widely deployed used in
all kinda platforms all over the place

109
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,699
an and assess which was originally the
netscape library which is now mostly

110
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,550
used by Firefox to do

111
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,810
am hold its crypto although to use in a
couple other is he a red hat uses a

112
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,630
quite different

113
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,960
is a quite simply as well so that ones
out there INEC el cielo

114
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,120
which were actually was call salt but no
one ever does

115
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,650
an and then our boat on which is
actually a relatively interesting

116
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,240
library I am it's one of the C library
that actually has a

117
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,000
a little bit better testing store even
most and which is why we can include

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,850
here that kinda interesting that case

119
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,919
I would come a computer from Apple we
look at the the Microsoft

120
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,949
an outside of things and what did at lib
secret which

121
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,160
when we got into this neither mister
never actually heard of an

122
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,990
and we were kinda shocked when we look
at the download counts and with G crib

123
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,500
was like

124
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,460
super high up and I and it turns out
that it's mostly I think a Debian been

125
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,250
that arent

126
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,770
yet the debt debbie has some strong
views on freeze offer of course in so

127
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,819
lip Gy trip to New Deal SRR something
they push I'll libraries to use art

128
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:17,229
group art packages inside the Reapers
you

129
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,190
yeah 08 ended up being quite widely
deployed much wider than we thought and

130
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,110
so we can spend a little time looking at
that and say

131
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,630
if you look at the top 10 at the supper
we cared about why we like we care that

132
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,750
it was open source

133
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,770
we hear that it was cross-platform right
we cared that it

134
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,430
was maintained an we did wanna look at
kinda

135
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,530
ubiquitous is kinda a little bit of
subject to measure but like how likely

136
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,639
is it that you as a developer or
consumer

137
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,660
your library we have access to that
particular piece I want to make sure

138
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,380
they have a standard algorithm so that
you can go and actually

139
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,740
nope ass for GCM and a GCM right and she
one thing that

140
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,060
be I'm not sure how much we care so much
about one thing it does come up in

141
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,199
incur conversations especially with your
larger enterprise customers

142
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,880
I'm is its compliance for comic right
here compliance and both which

143
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,440
are have granted by the US government
these days so I'm not

144
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,270
sure that we care as much anymore I
cannot stress enough you do not want

145
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,949
phipps

146
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:09,009
alright yes if you're going is open as
is I'll don't use that range that's

147
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:09,900
that's messed up

148
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,990
an seow anyway it's one of the things
that like you do hear about it

149
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,610
I think you know the NSA is pretty much
screwed up for everybody at this point

150
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,090
so I'm not sure that we care so much
anymore but it was something that we

151
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,780
looked at

152
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,389
an and of course you know I mean open
SSL comes out on top

153
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,400
now which is not too much of a surprise
I mean it was kind of what we expected

154
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,349
going into it but

155
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:31,199
there is another piece there anything
like any sales really call unfortunately

156
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,849
it doesn't really have a standard
algorithms that means that makes it

157
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:34,860
kinda hard

158
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,360
am so many things are really hard to
build and they don't necessarily work

159
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,940
too well in certain environments
obviously the Apple stuff and then

160
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,800
Microsoft stuff

161
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,650
you a reasonably good but some others
not open source it's obviously not

162
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,550
available on different platforms

163
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,050
and so having access to it is is not
super great answer

164
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,410
we're looking at these these type things
open as I was kinda were will spend most

165
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,770
of our time talking

166
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,050
and but it will talk a little bit later
there is we kinda allowed for ways for

167
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,000
people to use some of these other
options

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,009
and some cases there are really good
reasons if you're sitting on top of the

169
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,870
an Apple device are sitting on top of
something running Windows to use those

170
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,930
particular platforms rather than using a
bundled up messes up

171
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,949
an in fact on people that didn't have to
patch for part leader probably happy

172
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:13,710
about that moment

173
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,819
although they might have had to patch
for good while

174
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:20,990
an so kind of stepping up okay now we
look at the C library so now we know

175
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,080
what the state in the world is in see
those are our options right

176
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,940
so now we can look at how old what what
how papon can actually use those

177
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,110
libraries rain so there's a a series of
kinda Python libraries here

178
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,070
with an empty crypto pack up to open SSL
the pipe on a Sat skies and boat and

179
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,570
also has a a

180
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,839
area pipe number seven so we cared about
here was kinda what back and optical

181
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,849
fiber used so what's the library was
using actually do its work

182
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,190
again we care about maintenance and we
care deeply about Python support

183
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,000
right so we wanted to make sure that we
could do you cry 3 a.m. we could do

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,550
pipelines and these are the kind of
options that are out there

185
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,260
am which tends to be somewhat of a
problem for libraries that are dumping

186
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,060
everything on it to see

187
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,180
and we wanted to look at the stated
review for all these you'll notice that

188
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,850
the answer is no one told them this is
not a knock on anybody

189
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,730
and doing reviews like having
professional curb their reviews for this

190
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,560
type code

191
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,050
I is really very expensive and if you're
doing it right and pipe on you generally

192
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,290
not doing any crypto operations in
Python anyway

193
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,269
and sell not super critical but it was
something that we wanted to come to call

194
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:14,850
out

195
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,330
I lastly come completeness is very
subjective the kind of that

196
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,420
musical notes or whatever that we had on
the structure and say oh

197
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,120
am one's attention to call out since the
time that we pitch the stockpile open

198
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,709
SSL has actually

199
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,510
up rebased all in their library on top
of our labor could party which will talk

200
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,820
a little bit about later

201
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,760
and still sony's answers with the ass
tricks are basically because if you

202
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,070
take it as it is today it has much
better options than it did

203
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,339
about performance guestbook an bytes you
know some big ones that we saw I mean

204
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:45,540
obviously no pipe higher pay three
support

205
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,019
an and you could do just are just going
to maintain a while ago

206
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,300
yep just a few months ago yep so he's
been getting it get it working again in

207
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,440
those types of things

208
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,390
an you know and mostly kinda pylon sport
was a big problem for us and then of

209
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:57,800
course

210
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,430
Pike richter which is by far the most
widely deployed by Tiger to library

211
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,890
an which is great is that has its own
see back in

212
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,640
so it's kinda bespoke see and Britain
for themselves specifically for that

213
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,420
library

214
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,720
it's never been audited by anybody and
doesn't mean it's necessarily good or

215
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,300
bad just means that that that work has
been done yet

216
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,589
an and of course boat owners really
quite simple to build and install

217
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,680
I remember correctly yes easy to build a
boat and not so easy to get the python

218
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,810
bindings

219
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,660
I'm you know but the most important
thing for us that you can come out is

220
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,180
looking at is that almost all these
Python libraries

221
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,320
basically require that you was the
developer have a very deep understanding

222
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,200
of how the C library works

223
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,269
these are very very thin layers they're
not really

224
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,579
necessarily by phonic it's really just
like hey this is like literally the same

225
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:46,380
name that you see in the open SSLC code
is exactly what it exposes

226
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,380
in Python and you better know how to
combat and you can crash pipe on very

227
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,850
easily and you can do very bad things

228
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,560
and and it will prevent you from doing
any about and CEO there's no kind of

229
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,310
you know non foot gun version A B
libraries you're almost guaranteed to

230
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,000
blow your toes off unless you really
know what you don't

231
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,880
an after all that we looked in that okay
well do we view as always options

232
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,399
right we just went through 20 or 30 or
whenever different libraries do we

233
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,620
really need another one

234
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,730
and of course the answer that by any
real developers yes

235
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,820
an so Wikia

236
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,220
we don't want and Sue today we'll beat
any limit I'm talking about

237
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,850
on labor which we got to talking ask a
target I L

238
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,649
ads on Gabbert under pipe argue I see a
slash retire if you can

239
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,820
plan a pattern the main goals that we
wanted to achieve with

240
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,190
I with library was one to expand are
tested to make sure that has all the

241
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,779
modern arms that we want Sep

242
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,649
especially all the problems that we have
a TLS which will be a lovely talk

243
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:41,350
tomorrow

244
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,510
about the state of the lessee shall go
to that an

245
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,290
you'll be able to jump to something your
arms like to see and making sure we have

246
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,889
afford security all these various other
things are becoming much much much more

247
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:54,329
important activity porn for a long time
we just

248
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,980
chosen to ignore them pets having access
those modern our names is now getting

249
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,100
very very important wanted to make sure
the library was really really strongly

250
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,000
tested

251
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,170
and when those things that in fact we'll
talk a lot about how we gonna do testing

252
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,100
photography

253
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,209
and want to make sure that there was he
was a CDP I was safety faults so that if

254
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,990
you as a developer went and tried to use
it the same way that use every other

255
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,760
library right you have a problem solved

256
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,339
you on you do some searching you figure
out how to do it you take some coding

257
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,240
hey it works

258
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,350
right right well we know crystal and
that's hard because and

259
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,579
working and not working can look the
same right and CEO

260
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,800
we want to make sure that if you did the
same thing that the same thing was safe

261
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,470
right rather than having to know that if
you happen to pass one into this

262
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,060
function it turns out that that
completely %uh validate all the work

263
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,019
that you've done

264
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,440
I wanted to sport i buy my dawn three we
want it has on it was maintained

265
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,450
obviously

266
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,620
we wanted to have no known broken
options are libras out there right now

267
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,200
that

268
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,690
kinda for historical reasons are various
other reasons include things that are

269
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,010
known to be broken

270
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,060
and they're just expose like everything
else so if you don't happen to know that

271
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,610
and you use them then you've just

272
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,089
rigors of and then of course we want to
offer high-level API which will talk a

273
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:58,279
little bit about

274
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,959
when we get there say oh I did want to
call on all the people involved in Qatar

275
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,079
be because

276
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,430
working with open SSL enough to drive
anyone insane and so that the top four

277
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,889
contributors up here according to have
her on the top

278
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,740
one of which being Paul which are kinda
general jokers the Paul writes all the

279
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,490
code in the rest of us just reviewed

280
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,930
am in there about 30 or so people are
not going after all modestly but

281
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,920
there lots people who come hang out in
10 things I wanted to kinda call out for

282
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,260
this is that a lot of times

283
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,639
people think they can contribute to a
project like this if they're not going

284
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,570
to experts

285
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,310
and that's really not true and we've had
this I think

286
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,459
and at least five or ten other people
down here helped us with packaging

287
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,610
obviously we always need people to kinda
read and try out the docs and tell us

288
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,560
where they suck

289
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,870
opinions on a TI design various other
things are always important

290
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,130
right so you don't have to be a crypto
expert to come and help right and so if

291
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,089
you're interested in this

292
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,980
security is a thing that that you like
to get involved in a creek is something

293
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,019
that the kind of

294
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,230
floats your boat then come hang out on
IRC channel there's a link to it

295
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,589
an at the end that the talk here and you
don't have to be a crib to master be

296
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:57,699
able to do in fact I most definitely not

297
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:00,959
help I am but I do have a lot

298
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,269
alright so let's talk a little bit about
the actual structure the project

299
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:07,930
as a cryptography is based on see if a
fire which is a problem

300
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,760
a python package that allows you to be I
think business if I fans out there

301
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,120
so devise a python package that allows
you to define either

302
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,130
at the Abir Devi level on a set of
functions and then

303
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,639
binding into your Python code so that
you can pass back and forth

304
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,120
from sea to bite on a vice versa I
provide a buncha rappers are not seeking

305
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,920
to put Claire

306
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,550
and I'm character pointers and also to
other things and translate them into

307
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,860
Python strings in backing for them

308
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,350
do things that nature I'm which is very
nice along with allowing you to register

309
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,680
things for later garbage collection so
that way you can actually a

310
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,070
can hand out of the Python runtime and
not worry about any that stuff

311
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,949
I so at the very bottom where we have
our bindings on are bindings are

312
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:52,019
exactly that I'm in the primary case
there are a whole whole lot of

313
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,600
open SSL functions they're bound i'm
open SSL has a very

314
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,730
interesting API but that is not
particularly reliable

315
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,449
from version to version or even patch to
patch are so

316
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,860
we have a lot of if deaths unfortunately
but you know that just kinda mimics the

317
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,560
openness is only be at this point

318
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,519
on so at this with this is the layer
that actually on pay

319
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,529
up sorry excuse me this is the loop I
open SSL consumes

320
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:19,410
as a 0.14 which I wouldn't like to call
out and think JP

321
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,370
very very much for actually going ahead
and doing that I'm that allows my own a

322
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,300
cell to run on by 2.3

323
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,070
my pie and also frees him from the
burden of ever having to deal with any

324
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,860
the C bindings again and soap I opens as
I was now pure Python package

325
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,130
I'm and if the m2 crib to maintain
happens to be in the audience I would be

326
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,100
happy to discuss whether or not that's
possible to do for you as well

327
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,670
I'm at the next level we have has met
layer

328
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,959
SoCal it is literally called the house
met layer on to do use it

329
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,540
you use I could talk if you don't have
met II

330
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,060
this is the layer that allows you to do
things that crypto allow so that means

331
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,190
anything that you can do in crypto you
can do in here that include shooting

332
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,480
yourself in the foot

333
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,089
on in fact this is the lair where
shooting yourself in the foot is pretty

334
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:03,880
likely

335
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,220
I so we would prefer people not use this
layer however if you know what you're

336
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,709
doing

337
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,170
well we can stop you we certainly
written a lot of documentation for every

338
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,620
single function that exists in it

339
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,660
we talked about every single block
cipher every single screen saver

340
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,660
all the different padding modes for our
say we've exposed whether or not those

341
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,970
payments make sense

342
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,490
whether or not you need to be no how you
do thought length recovery in

343
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,110
probabilistic signature scheme things
that major those are all there and it

344
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,970
has met

345
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,810
those are all things ideally you
shouldn't really need to worry about

346
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,160
because at the top where we have

347
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,509
the recipes now the moment we only have
one recipe so

348
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:39,089
your unfortunate have to you has made
let you into a whole lot

349
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,399
but the recipes are designed to be

350
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,660
one-shot russians a one-shot they're
designed to be box and box model where

351
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,190
you can

352
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,660
send in some data sins and bites get
back some bites

353
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,980
and not have to worry about anything
else on so right now we have

354
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,540
Burnett which is actually a on Azad so
that would be an authenticated

355
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,290
encryption with additional data but

356
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,730
are yet to really know about it is it's
encrypt the data but has our NH Mac for

357
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,720
authentication to verify that no one's
change the data

358
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,459
so you get to generate a key you passing
data and you get back your income today

359
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,010
to

360
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,130
and then when you need to be I'm the
crib that you do the exact same thing

361
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,530
and that's all you need to know you
don't need to know what initialization

362
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,230
factors are you don't need to know what
announces you don't need to know the

363
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,339
difference between the two is

364
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,100
which by the way even kept our first
will have trouble telling you the

365
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,030
difference

366
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,299
II and you certainly don't need to worry
about whether or not re you serve those

367
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,799
things is going to be a problem

368
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,510
or how many bytes you're allowed to
encrypt before you're gonna start having

369
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,450
probability of

370
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,820
for use and things of that nature so a

371
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,900
certainly a anybody who's interested in
in these sorts of things recipes are

372
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,370
where we actually your ideas

373
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,700
we want to know what your use cases are
and what you need to solve

374
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,400
because we can't build recipes or at
least trying convince crypto Gophers we

375
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,780
know

376
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,820
lbh is now considered you I'm

377
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,880
we would certainly a like to know those
that that information's week actually

378
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,760
build these recipes appropriately

379
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,450
alright so as part of this whole system
we have a concept called back ends

380
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,490
on our system is built to be agnostic to
the underlying C library

381
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,820
and that means that you can choose
whatever back and you want

382
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,000
maybe you really hate open SSL maybe you
think are clear is just the tip of the

383
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,590
iceberg

384
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,549
and you would rather go over news coming
crypto I'm come crypto is

385
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:24,130
actually currently are preferred back
and %uh no están I'm we don't actually

386
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,450
implement any the secure transport
component so

387
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,400
know the part that had recent bugs are
implemented

388
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,220
are you however I we also have a concept
called multi back in

389
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,830
and the purpose a multi-pack industry
eventually allow us to basically

390
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,650
composed

391
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,970
as many back and says we want such that
you can choose

392
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,160
I actually wanted use poly 1305 which is
a

393
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,809
a DJ beating from from the salt library
and I want to use that beat I'm

394
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,390
with a yes for some reason and why you
do that maybe Wed

395
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:58,380
are maybe when you charge I and you want
to add have you wanna hashed out against

396
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,830
Blake to I'm those are things that right
now there are it would be very difficult

397
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,100
to do wanna see library but within our
libraries that allow you to compose

398
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,039
across the

399
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,640
the different back in San it will
actually stitch them together such that

400
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,520
you'll be able to accomplish those goals

401
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,530
on obviously as part of this the ideas
that NEC backing can be included

402
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,360
on we've tried to structure that the
system such that the Bakken can either

403
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:18,919
implement

404
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,450
all the different interfaces that we
have or it can implement just want

405
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,309
so maybe on one back and you choose to
employ the cipher system and the cipher

406
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:29,360
system says okay I understand the
concept a block ciphers I understand the

407
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,630
concept a symmetric ciphers

408
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,950
upside block ciphers stream ciphers I'm
and then

409
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,130
it also understands the ideas behind are
saying Tsan

410
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,960
it can handle 8:30 p.m. TOTP which are
one-time password a

411
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,450
protocols that are backed by each Mac
and they the

412
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,309
you can bill all these things or you can
have one that just says okay I only

413
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:50,490
implement hasher's and

414
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,340
actually I only implement this one hash
on which when in this case would be like

415
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,950
something likely be too

416
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,539
which is an implicit implementation
oblique to public too was a a

417
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:03,260
cha three finalist a bit actually has
very similar security properties too

418
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,620
shocked though the finals for

419
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,260
the winner shot to on chunk 3 was
actually chosen because it was very

420
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,030
different from shot too because they
wanted

421
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,710
not keep all their eggs in one basket
yes i mean that

422
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,970
the idea multi back in as it gets really
powerful one we have the ability to

423
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,090
include come single-shot library is
likely that script or it would be to

424
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,260
your various other things

425
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,760
along with open as a seller various
other things right so you can choose to

426
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,870
use a particular library that you want

427
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,679
and then if you need a function that's
not part of that it can fall back on

428
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,470
another library in a different back and

429
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,679
and then you is a developer in the
pipeline Co don't have to change your

430
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,140
code media's things

431
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,090
so for example you know what when you're
looking at her bleed or something like

432
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,010
that if you're running Python clued you
literally could just

433
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,140
flip a switch and use a different back
and right and

434
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,450
that's a weird use case but it does
allow you to do those types of things

435
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,490
and also allows you to write a singles
and a python code that

436
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,549
on when to run on different platforms
will you different back and depending on

437
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:56,059
what the platform that supports

438
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,240
yeah I mean a more concrete example of
why this might be beneficial as

439
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,490
if you compile and so there are ways you
can use Python code in iowa's in their

440
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,890
ways you can use Python code

441
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,220
in up another unusual platforms that are
not dust-up

442
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,890
on on the Iowa side now we have not
don't go out and try this year cuz I

443
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,039
actually haven't tested

444
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,030
but common crypto is bug has the exact
same interfaces II says it doesn't know

445
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,679
is 10

446
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,780
so if you are actually capable compiling
a

447
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,820
the Python you need then this code would
work just fine

448
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,030
in Derry in theory deep am so i didnt I
meant before I want to talk a little bit

449
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,510
about

450
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,559
how we do testing the testing was a big
consideration for

451
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,330
the library that we want to choose
something we want to make sure we did a

452
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:36,820
really

453
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,640
really great job in so as in right now
every time that you

454
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,450
run what we call Crime a single test run
Inc retard a free

455
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,200
you're running about church the
sixty-six thousand or so

456
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,480
tests an and then it each run is
basically a combination of a whole bunch

457
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,799
of actors and white whatever back in you
using and what have a platform you're on

458
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,610
an all these various other things right

459
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,590
so for every build that we run which
includes every single PR that somebody

460
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,690
puts an anytime that we're running a
full build

461
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,309
you're actually doing 77 abuse runs
right which works out there's 15

462
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:13,190
about 15 bill today we average between
10 to 20 which works out to be about

463
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,360
almost watt 5.1 million tests per build

464
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,610
which means that right now we're doing
about $500 million tests per week

465
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,870
and to build right now takes about 20
minutes so it kinda depends upon the a

466
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,909
how how busy Travis is and whether
notching conceals like working but I S

467
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:32,210
in general we take about 10 to 20
minutes to run our bills

468
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:36,419
yep so we also do 45 docking station
bills per day most to this is don Travis

469
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:37,980
Sep there any time as people in here

470
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,059
thank you we take up an enormous amount
of their infrastructure

471
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,330
I think we're like in their top five
people for wrecking their stuff

472
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,270
an we've been helping them build a
python support though so hopefully it

473
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,039
works out

474
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,740
an and then we also have our engines
builder that runs on top a Rackspace

475
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,630
Rackspace gives us a free card account
to use for this and we've got

476
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,140
25-28 builders are splayed servers that
run down on it

477
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,559
there's 24 actual Jenkins builders which
means there's less servers but

478
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,330
we actually run our tests against Ubuntu
1204 I sent us five-cent 064

479
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,480
a because 65 plus real a actually have a

480
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,740
later open SSL that doesn't have a look
to curb disabled

481
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,900
we also run tests against I was 10 10.7%
10.8% 10.9%

482
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,030
FreeBSD 92 FreeBSD 10 and I believe
there's a few other things in there that

483
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,030
I'm not remembering

484
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,919
young might building open as OpenBSD
builder since we discover that they

485
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,850
forgot to include parts %uh vocalists
obviously

486
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,600
am cs3 the type of thing that has the
infrastructure actually fines for us

487
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,820
which is very nice

488
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,650
an but it is an absolute enormous amount
of attesting the kids are now obviously

489
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,799
when you doing local development you can
run subset to these kids are basically

490
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,710
running kinda business

491
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,490
myer which is not so bad and of course
%uh many things get skips depending on

492
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,799
various platforms that you're working
with and some other types things these

493
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,870
numbers are a little bit kinda estimates
but

494
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,690
yes %uh the biggest challenge we've had
with our testing infrastructure a plate

495
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,700
is that we are

496
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,730
we require one hundred percent code
coverage on ok

497
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,630
no patches ever allowed to land for any
reason knows no pragma new covers

498
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,140
allowed

499
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,600
on so the only way to land only actually
reminds me

500
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,350
we have a bunch Windows builders but
forgot to mention on the only reason any

501
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,730
patch neverland as if it's when I resent
code coverage

502
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,980
and its past peer review so no one can
ever merge their own patches

503
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,090
I and usually there's three or four
people who end up

504
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,120
reviewing any one of our patches so

505
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,510
at the end that we am into usually with
any reason we size matches about a

506
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,610
hundred

507
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:34,710
comments and mood we generally require
use putting a patch up a bit exceed

508
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,559
about a hundred lines maybe 150 lines
ago

509
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,130
there's anything we're good at it bike
shipping an

510
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,940
they realize what we currently spa right
now so I we have a good selection this

511
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,570
matter albums are out there now that's
what we tackled first

512
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,500
and lotsa stuff so any MBAs to the you
expect clearly a troubled as Cat five

513
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,559
any type things are all kinda in there

514
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,529
am obviously there's more work getting
done there I think there is a patch for

515
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,070
some

516
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:01,029
sows I'm trying to land sea but it turns
out that everybody per so subscribe talk

517
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:03,820
if these problems right now they're
probably all here so nobody's actually

518
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,659
going anywhere green

519
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:09,350
an at pretty good support for each
Maximus the h-back stuff that you would

520
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,409
an you would want is there we also have
a constant I'm bit that was

521
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:16,799
submitted by someone in this room Julian
cress you mean we will be in the room

522
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,240
like to thank you feeling

523
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,830
doing constant I'm comparisons and
Python by the way not easy

524
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,520
an when you just go down and see a UNC
Yuji

525
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,760
am so we got some key derivation
function so that

526
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,900
at PKF to use I with the track it KDF

527
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,929
I we did one time password stuff so this
is due to be an Asian if he is there

528
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:38,090
grew up in Decatur algorithms that the
use for their app for two-factor

529
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,500
an got RCA signing verification

530
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,120
an get the permit stuff we talked before
which i think is Soroka rate

531
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,600
so once again did you know those
rejoiced extracted from some guy

532
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,080
internal use cases at her local

533
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,710
and say we talk a little bit before an
you know we've

534
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,460
we pulled in a much tougher the process
a panoply things and cartography is that

535
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,150
first level kinda creating the bindings

536
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,750
right and we write has malware stuff on
top of that mankind up the the recipes

537
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,260
come on

538
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,120
come up on the top so as we pull in new
see back and various other things settle

539
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,010
you expose the ability for us to do all
these various to protect things

540
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,330
Amsale let's go back in and review
little bit I'm kinda but the beginning

541
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,929
we talked about what we want a crypto
library so we wanted our in support

542
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:19,650
rights to the fact that we do multi back
and gives us that rates if you want to

543
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,289
use

544
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,740
NEC Alan you some other weird you be
stopper whatever you can do that

545
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,850
and you can also have a back in that
supports the regular standard algorithms

546
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,770
that are out there

547
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,570
right and SIL gonna sell obviously is
the big one that we use our ways but

548
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,590
most the time on

549
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,870
but of course you can use whatever back
in it secretary sports

550
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,360
it is open source the holdings under
Apache two am most the people who were

551
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,679
involved at least the beginning

552
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,400
upgrading this were Rackers at this
point it's pretty much wide open as

553
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,840
people from all over the place

554
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,049
an and all the world to you add palin
supports so

555
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:52,120
am boobs bad competing John am

556
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:58,600
so obviously we supports an 26 27 32 33
34 in pipelines all this work

557
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,220
and then there after maintain from a
means test we talk about testing

558
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,240
as about over 30 people now that are
working on on Qatar be

559
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,730
I would like more if you did to join us
if you want to come in hang out

560
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,299
whether your'e crypto expert or not we
would love to have you an

561
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:17,929
so talk a little about kinda what's next
SOA on the future work side and there's

562
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:18,779
lots to do still

563
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:22,620
I'm we've been working on this project
for home she's nine months

564
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,880
no guess maybe not quite that much n but
there's just

565
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,980
I an immense amount of work still to go
a while we

566
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,240
you may have noticed that we wrote that
we have our say signing and verification

567
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,929
and that does include a relatively
complex component PKC is 1.5 actually

568
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:37,330
very simple but oh ATP are

569
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,340
sorry there with the PSS my case is not
at all on

570
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,830
however we don't actually we load keys
right now

571
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,940
I'm so if you guys wanted convert them
into integers and then load them

572
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,720
directly through

573
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,880
than the work fine but most people
probably want to do that so

574
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,990
one other things we really need to work
on is we are happy to see is one in pDCs

575
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,409
aid

576
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:59,549
key loads I world's gonna probably look
at OJ BK and some other

577
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:02,750
be keep the G cereals Asian stuff I'm

578
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,809
we also have of course DS a signing
verification and as part of that we will

579
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:08,929
be defaulting to deterministic a I'm

580
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:13,080
so those are you familiar with the essay
signing it turns out the DS a signing is

581
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,809
unbelievably sensitive to the quality a
random number generated I'm

582
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:20,909
and if you do not have great random
numbers especially the Jazz reuse it

583
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:21,630
every time

584
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,640
then you can lead the entire contents be
proud to keep very quickly

585
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,470
is actually how the PlayStation 3 was
cracked they had a new CD is a privately

586
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,100
that they were using to sign their

587
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,320
firmware but the use the exact same
signature

588
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,419
letters are the exact same generated on
Brendon Kay every time

589
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:41,640
and because of that they lead everything
and then that allowed custom firmware

590
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,039
which

591
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:45,580
I guess for that we shall thank them I'm

592
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,100
but im we will definitely turn it now
defaulting deterministic a

593
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,399
up and then of course we have a nice big
question there around expo ninety less

594
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:57,010
out we're pretty sure we're gonna go
ahead in implement this but this is

595
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,419
going to be a long term project

596
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:03,570
X 509 is a very large spec in incumbent
Nick as politics so now y'all September

597
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,659
all the San Juan so those are all things
there in openness is oh those are all

598
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,630
things that other libraries but exposing
them in what we would consider see maybe

599
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,429
I am

600
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:15,279
me like discussions and if you guys have
an opinion about those things come talk

601
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:15,880
to us

602
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,340
we're happy to hear more more opinions
doesn't mean are right

603
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,510
fact most the time and probably wrong a
and of course the less

604
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,950
a we have obviously much did there's
much to talk about it. last but I'm

605
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,020
going to let him do that at the source
said about the sale tomorrow so you guys

606
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,570
y'all

607
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,299
definitely attend that you can learn
about how everyone does everything

608
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:35,399
really really poorly

609
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,690
and there's no end in sight

610
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,990
however maybe there is an end in sight
at least on the pipeline site we we will

611
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,750
be spending some time talking very
seriously about what a teal SAPI looks

612
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,049
like

613
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:50,409
in the near future how you would
implement that and allowed to be

614
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:51,899
composable with other backends

615
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,760
such that we don't actually have to
implement the the semester credits cuz

616
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,840
we have no interest in doing that

617
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,100
on been the final days we're very
interested in some the last comments

618
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,970
metric minutes

619
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,929
a those things that are more about DJ
beware on which be things that salt

620
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,399
mackail-smith so those are you really he
calling itself an

621
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:14,149
so toucher 20 which is actually a so
just a 20 is a derivative salsa 20

622
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:18,529
and actually Google is very enamored of
it so %uh charge a 20% with poly 1305 is

623
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:19,039
a Mac

624
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,470
are the are actually cipher suites that

625
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,890
google has implemented in their Taylor
stack and actually supports in chrome

626
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,809
right now

627
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:29,929
now they're talking with I ATF other
people about whether or not that becomes

628
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,830
an official thing and he was 13 or maybe
even sooner who knows

629
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,549
but those sorts of things are becoming a
little more common as NIST has

630
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:39,990
kinda hurt their own reputation I'm
that's not to say

631
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,559
I that their crypto is anyway anyway
actually bad but

632
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,419
their reputation has been damaged in
that means that people are looking

633
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:47,520
outside of them

634
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,049
a either to things like crypt wreck
which is the Japanese body there's a

635
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:55,200
there's European one that slipping my
mind at the moment

636
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,130
there's I'm giving Korean ones which is
actually the CD album comes from which

637
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,090
is another 120 but whatever

638
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,990
I so there's lotsa stuff and there's
lots more work to do i mean there's even

639
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,990
things that aren't on here many many
things are near Lexie Mac

640
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,250
which is a way of doing max using block
ciphers

641
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:15,640
that is a wealth it will standardize but
its bill Italy unused

642
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,450
and there's something weird we're
definitely interested in like ultimately

643
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,340
we want to become

644
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,760
a cryptographic standard library only
hopefully better maintain

645
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,940
than standard libraries usually are

646
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,940
and i mean that that ultimately our Argo

647
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,130
the sale admitted to get a blank
obviously the

648
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,490
garvey Diana it on Pepsi can install it
we actually put a

649
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,019
minor wheels up their search should
install and a precompiled for most

650
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:39,519
severe

651
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,090
now now by

652
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,740
X white aggression by binary wheels are
not I i are very difficult to do for

653
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,870
Linux and OS 10 points are so you can do
them on Windows which is what we have

654
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,190
been for which is also the

655
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,730
a platform that small least likely to
have a compiler if you wish to install

656
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,350
pippin

657
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,279
if you wish to keep in stock photography
I would highly recommend having the open

658
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:58,950
SSL have

659
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,350
headers and also a compiler and then
most that

660
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,140
work we hang out on RCC weren't retarded
ass dev which leads to not only people

661
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,360
talking about this library but also this
many people to come to talk to other

662
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,929
people because they happen to fight

663
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,649
yeah we we didn't use the most data
specific name for our project

664
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:18,779
new now an so we can to happen to do
this little bit we can to tweak the

665
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,149
slides this morning's wanted a

666
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:23,130
to have a little bit more time for
questions am so that's all we're gonna

667
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,019
cover for now

668
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:27,390
I guess there's a at microphone over
here somewhere

669
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,399
so if you like to ask questions please
come up if you're going to some buzz

670
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,720
about cricket things ask Paul not me

671
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,120
please don't to me it's really easy

672
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,120
her a guy's great are thanks some I just
wanted to

673
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,149
ask you mentioned implementing in sn1
parser

674
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:50,890
are I was wondering if you knew about
pie sn1 in a few rejected it or what

675
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,450
so we have not rejected in any way I am
familiar with buyers and one but I don't

676
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,690
know enough about it to know whether or
not it needs some

677
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,309
what I need so I would very much prefer
to do it all pure my time so the fact

678
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:03,039
that bias and one is pure Python and and
supports

679
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,460
hypothetically everything we need is a
big encouragement but that would be the

680
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,630
very first place we look

681
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,200
cool thanks the use of it's on the list
of things to do we have decided how to

682
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,769
do it

683
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:16,690
speak in a pure Python feel free to
slimy know about this wrong but

684
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,720
did you guys actually craft and document

685
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,070
away to guarantee the minimum and
maximum runtime

686
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,590
love constant I'm in linear time
operations for the sense that things

687
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,870
like age max

688
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:34,460
for is that conjectured constant or
linear time

689
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,700
so its constant I'm comparison because
we do it down at the seal air

690
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,919
where we guarantee that it takes exactly
that long now there's a transition

691
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,279
period from

692
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,039
my time to see and back however because
that's the same number of bytes in the

693
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:47,950
way to copy which

694
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,840
should work that should also be constant
I'm however I can tell you that for sure

695
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,340
okay I had misunderstood you when you
said are what you're doing in Python

696
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,000
emergency

697
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,909
thank you yes I about that because all
the constant I'm verification we do is

698
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:01,890
actually done at the sea level

699
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,240
I think we do have a long-term goal love
having Qatar be audited

700
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,929
an maybe we can con Rackspace and paying
for it an

701
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,849
but that'll be a little bit further down
the road I think before we do that if

702
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,450
you can get somebody else to pick up the
bill asked them to do

703
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,460
you know Isabel formal verification that
a lot

704
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:23,460
definitely be good use a money in time
absolutely

705
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,690
well we're talking about money and
certification if you can do

706
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,710
assisi or something along those kind of
the creative

707
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:34,310
I conquered here yeah um my company

708
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:38,470
uses a I think itself for cover when SSL

709
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:42,280
arm that this trips certified I

710
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,149
how he's so I I miss most of your cart
this coming near the end but you said

711
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:53,470
it works with open SSL um I would
imagine as long as we don't mock with

712
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,000
their open this is all headers each work
with our

713
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,700
apps certified openness that's correct
so open SSL has a 50 module

714
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,780
and when you have the Phipps module
engaged in there's

715
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,349
inside the code there's a bunch if death
just send it down the Phipps paths

716
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:12,010
I'm so if you compile cryptography
against open SSL phipps

717
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,730
then it will use nothing but the Phipps
patch I'm with all the commensurate

718
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,260
statements that that accompanies like
that early I actually had said that

719
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,859
I don't really particularly care for
phipps one of the reasons I don't care

720
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:24,530
for that there's regulatory requirements
and then you just need to use it but

721
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,550
what are the reasons I don't
particularly care for phipps

722
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,750
is that it does not allow for the
concept of bugs

723
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,150
are when you on it code for phipps when
it becomes

724
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,510
its complaint you can never touch that
code again without reloading

725
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,320
that doesn't matter if you find in
enormous game stopping

726
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,800
everything breaking bug because that's
been found in the open this is off thats

727
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,570
module

728
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,369
and they are not allowed to fix it
that's only in

729
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:52,099
the dual ECU random number generator so
nobody's using it to don't worry about

730
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:56,560
did thank you abrupt

731
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,339
hi I'm which my elaborating on why the

732
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:04,410
the Python language all a part of my
cold is no particular suitable for all

733
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,910
our can sometime comparisons

734
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,410
sure so I'll in general pythons
attempting did to optimize and do things

735
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,060
and as quickly as it can and in in as
part of that behavior

736
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,240
my final short circuit logic I'm in
general you know if you know that

737
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,400
after valuating you trying to evaluate
the quality of two byte strings right

738
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,990
and after the first byte you notice 0
actually they don't match

739
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,109
on so why bother comparing the rest of
them on

740
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:34,720
so that that is our in the sling
comparisons

741
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,070
logic right month to I mean if if you
believe your own comparison logic men

742
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,670
that wouldn't Tom I mean basically

743
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:47,430
the problem is with the law that string
comparison logic is not with the

744
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,520
language are with the

745
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,200
pipe on my called so 230 semester but
when you start dealing with big numbers

746
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,630
I'm iPhone also has a whole lotta
optimizations for dealing with big

747
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,390
numbers

748
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,849
are so if you start wanting to do arce
rdsa operations are gonna be dealing

749
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:03,490
with 2048 bit in larger numbers

750
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,710
and that number handling even the actual
tonight

751
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,780
if you ask on papon how many bits it it
is with bit like

752
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,329
that actually can leak i win we did I I
don't remember exactly so don't don't

753
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:17,300
take this as gospel but I believe
whatever

754
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,890
when the guys we have working with us
Alex Stapleton was looking at it look

755
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,280
like

756
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,440
that there was a timing attack but
potentially available that leaked

757
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,460
something about the number up ones were
zeros in the pits

758
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,520
so it's it's little things like that let
you may be able to avoid each one of

759
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,609
those things

760
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:35,880
if you know about them but every time
you do that you're spending a bunch more

761
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,920
effort trying to

762
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,030
figure out what it is pipelines actually
doing okay thanks

763
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,060
I miss the same from you have even see
it it's it's not easy to rate I mean

764
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,980
consultancy right pick eilers are always
trying to get smarter and sorcery

765
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,880
because he wasn't going to look at some
the open SSL stuff

766
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,900
that C code is really nasty and hard to
follow specifically because it's

767
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,950
designed to defeat

768
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,130
compiler optimizations and some other
things that are in there and it's and

769
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,290
it's the charitable view

770
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,430
yes one of the many reasons it and

771
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,450
be by the United so as the papon
runtimes get smarter or as you run

772
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,849
different run times that behavior might
change of many

773
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:09,210
you see you may have thought that you
did it right first time but then when

774
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,050
you're running on pipe I that's not true
anymore whatever answer

775
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:16,450
probably not impossible just hard

776
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,119
heights so earlier you'd mention that
the reputation UHV

777
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,220
miss head kinda been downgraded because
I've

778
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,450
the I guess arce I'm

779
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,460
not on our ability but you know weakling
so

780
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,070
I want I'm curious where you're looking
for

781
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,119
other standards and resources on

782
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,280
as months that are more reputed ball and
and what are you

783
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,980
can i'm saying is that that I'm the best
ones out there

784
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,060
so that's a great question in the
answers I don't know I'm

785
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,329
in general wellness missus been
tarnished because either

786
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:55,910
mean the charitable view and the view I
actually personally subscribe to is that

787
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,500
they were probably a patsy

788
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,089
they didn't they they didn't necessarily
do anything wrong but they allowed

789
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:05,980
bad things to happen and that's not
necessarily a good thing

790
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,099
it seems actually self-evident

791
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:12,450
that means that to me there their specs
are actually still fine

792
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,599
am with the exception of one of them on
there's no evidence of any kind like

793
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,420
shot to shit

794
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,560
shot three certainly actually shot three
the actual even took

795
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,020
publica feedback into account and they
were originally trying to speed up for

796
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,470
a variety of what may or may not have
been good reasons

797
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,510
but they actually backed off that
because community was concerned so they

798
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,920
they kept the previous resistance at 2n

799
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,180
for that the bit like and then

800
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,510
but I I started back to your point B

801
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,680
there are really a whole lot other
bodies that do this stuff on

802
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,810
so like their script wreck from Japan
others keyser

803
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:51,240
which isn't Korea and again I and I
apologize I cannot remember

804
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,359
one the guys who do it over in europe
but a

805
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,030
nothing really do a whole lot work
likenesses constantly holding

806
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,260
competitions are constantly doing work

807
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,770
arm so in the end either its gonna
continue to be missed a mean shot three

808
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,099
is

809
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:09,670
well-respected well it's not technically
shelter yet but will be soon it's very

810
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,790
well-respected 0

811
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:15,069
I N while people are gonna be very
cautious to an initial uptake

812
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:18,180
overtime it probably will prove to be a
good idea

813
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,630
I'm otherwise I think maybe

814
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:25,210
you've actually got some shift into
academia even which is kinda surprising

815
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,990
given academia is kinda history of not
caring about actual implementation

816
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:32,560
other DJ B is a recently been running a
a

817
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,920
I forget the name of his is crypto
contest but there's actually a new

818
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,960
crypto contest for finding new ciphers

819
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,079
on the just but just close submissions
and there's been the room

820
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:44,500
undersea missions and they're actually
being evaluated now and that's been this

821
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,530
all that was their whole emo that's how
they built but I yes was built

822
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,660
because as: was set up a whole lot of

823
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,319
rounds of competition against a bunch
different block ciphers started with RIP

824
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,200
bottom

825
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,510
a whole bunch in the end it turned into
right all which became

826
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:05,290
a yes I so that may be workers long term
but for now it's pretty much just missed

827
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:08,109
now we're at it we will crack down on
the conversations that was going on is

828
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:11,290
that you may be nice formal methods to
talk about crypto in academia

829
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,780
where you can actually do security
purposes with him those are still

830
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,200
relatively new but like

831
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,770
there's some pretty good formalism there
and usually lotta times the

832
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,829
that formalism an academic ends at the
implementation where

833
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:25,510
and most at the the bugs in the problems
that were senior implementation bugs not

834
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,680
political books

835
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,349
am in Sioux there's kind of a lot of
discussion going on in the academically

836
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:32,880
and Mac green and some other guys come
in talking about it works like

837
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,710
oh well as script harper's if you want
to actually build

838
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,619
ciphers that people can use that are
actually useful for anybody you have to

839
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:42,510
worry about the implementation just as
much as you have to worry about

840
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,819
be criticizing so not we'll see how it
goes but

841
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:49,550
the answer your question is whose but

842
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,690
thanks I was also wondering you know you
said that this was

843
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,810
I guess point version point 14 what do
you

844
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,960
what features do you see is you know
being robust enough to

845
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,170
to have a version wine and and what do
you envision for that

846
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:08,829
so 14 is actually play open SSL which
has been around for over a decade soho

847
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:12,060
I don't know that he's ever going to get
a 1.0 you have to ask JP

848
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,250
I have however on our side were actually
a 0.3 right now

849
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,540
a I don't know what constitutes 1.0 we
may change our versioning scheme before

850
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,060
we ever even get there

851
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,260
there's the act the heck not here he
would vastly prefer us to be version

852
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,790
based on data released

853
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,720
but we'll see hi we're using our keys
are internally

854
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,780
and I'm has really good support for arm
for versioned

855
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,880
version key material which is really
really useful in our environment do you

856
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,609
plan on supporting some bike that is out

857
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:43,630
something that's going to come down the
road so we're definitely interested

858
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,690
we have not it has not been prioritised
because none of the people who are

859
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,300
working on it right now use keys are

860
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,480
over we're aware that and and its if
you're a interest in talking more about

861
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,030
how we might go about implementing I'll
be happy to talk about ashes your

862
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,720
yeah definitely interested in like we've
been playing around with it on the side

863
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,930
of it but none of us use in production
and so we haven't

864
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:04,210
the whole experience with it hate first
I'll am

865
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:10,140
what he called bike-sharing incident
parkinson's love to reality

866
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,670
would like China later and via the

867
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,079
constant time compare bails out if
they're different links why doesn't it

868
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:19,430
just exploded

869
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,460
as like exception I don't know the
answer them off the top of my head

870
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,960
seems like that would be a mistake and
would be something to fail about

871
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,020
rather than simply you know potentially
be could into a time

872
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,740
attack so are we currently doing that
you have to go to

873
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,950
I with documentation of the code but I
was co-owner

874
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,859
honest to beat me I hope it is if it's
not then we definitely should fix one of

875
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:42,750
those two things

876
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,660
but I will have to look at that I
actually don't know the answer I'm

877
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,470
certainly

878
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,980
I would prefer that we do the right
thing

879
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,930
it you would prefer we do the right
thing payments pack I'm very committed

880
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,950
to me that

881
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,050
yeah it and yeah so constant I'm compare

882
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,250
popular topic I guess arm you mention
that

883
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,550
all changes require foale test coverage

884
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,030
and you mention that there is a constant
I'm compare function

885
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:11,450
%ah what is your unit test for cut that
actually be in constant time look like

886
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,140
so you could UK you hit on the one piece
or infrastructure that I'm not really

887
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,109
happy with the testing a jeep

888
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:21,450
and I and that is that at the seal air
I'm we can't guarantee Falcons coverage

889
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,069
because

890
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:25,710
well we don't have the interpretability
introspect in to see if I from there

891
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:30,010
are so everything is just a stream that
we pass and so we don't know that we've

892
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,400
actually evaluated

893
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,040
in practice the only way we're doing our
valuation love that line is basically

894
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,490
saying

895
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,410
well does it evaluate true does it raise
when it's not when exposed to

896
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:43,589
on so and otherwise we've just had three
or four people are five I don't remember

897
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:44,400
how many was

898
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,910
look at it and say yeah it looks like
it's protons constant I'm

899
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,730
do you have thoughts on future
improvements that are it's a big

900
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,480
question mark

901
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,180
so it's a big question mark to me there
may be other members the team got better

902
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,609
ideas about it but from

903
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,920
for my part I don't know the answer to
that question yet like me I dearly want

904
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,550
to help

905
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,300
better test coverage on that side but I
don't know how to go about it right now

906
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,780
ankle thanks Anthony we got time for one
more question

907
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,930
so you know recent her plea stuff

908
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:16,410
home some people are calling the opener
so maintainers negligent for not using

909
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,390
lips he's American Free arm for

910
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,750
performance reasons and on earth you
know the recent news is affected your

911
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,270
confidence and openness

912
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:30,640
so I a good thing workers thousands of
question

913
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,130
I I've been down and open SSL long
enough that I don't know that my

914
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,750
confidence could be shaken it cuz it was
already shaken

915
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,849
a home I the base parts have open SSL

916
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:45,410
are very good on however there are
things like this that happen

917
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,349
obviously too often cause even once is
too often but ultimately it is software

918
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:53,079
I and its offer this very old I'm

919
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,000
me maybe not old in some senses but in
another sense it's more than 25

920
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,040
this year since it was started at this
point I see the best practices a change

921
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,089
dramatically testing best practices a
change dramatically

922
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:07,470
10 business as a solo star the C
preprocessor was considered the greatest

923
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:08,220
thing on earth

924
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,030
and you needed write a macro for
everything in your macros you call a

925
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,180
macro in that matter she got three more
macros

926
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,480
are those things are not usually
considered best practice anymore

927
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,150
%uh so and actually even when they
originally put in their Mallorcan free

928
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,420
implementation there may very well have
been a very good reason for like 15

929
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,040
years ago

930
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,079
Malik implementations could it better
absolutely been problematic

931
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,790
not the reason the more so that's not
really a defense a

932
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,990
really what ultimately at my concern
with open SSL is that it's

933
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:39,550
a critical piece of infrastructure and
it has one full-time developer it has

934
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,270
less

935
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:44,420
it has less work going on with it then
this project

936
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:48,150
on and that concerns me they had a
three-day funding challenge I think they

937
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,170
made nine hundred bucks

938
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,920
yeah I mean like this is probably one of
the most important piece is a software

939
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,450
that will deploy and we all deploy
everywhere

940
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,400
like as somebody who works at Rackspace
right now like literally rebooting every

941
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,240
device that a customer has because

942
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,440
leon we need to patch all the stuff for
them it's an enormous in about

943
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,740
and nobody supported you know and so
it's like that something that will be

944
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,150
arguing with with our people that

945
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,420
to try to get back to pony up some money
at least am

946
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,560
because this is one of those things that
needs to be pay more attention to you

947
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,099
and we haven't been paying a lot of
attention

948
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:20,030
but luckily yeah so I guess ultimately
the the answer question is

949
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,250
yes it concerns me but it doesn't
concern me any more than a good are

950
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:27,030
every other implementation concerns me
this is just that latest email

951
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:30,780
I'm I'll see reserve hopefully serious
wake-up calls for us on the way we do

952
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:35,240
these things

953
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,950
yes sure they do they would love that we
welcome summer 240 million that we can

954
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,339
find

955
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:42,490
yep alright I think we're done thank you
very much at

956
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:42,780
figure
