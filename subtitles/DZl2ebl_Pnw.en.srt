1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,660
during obscured

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,679
0

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,679
publicly

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,730
I was I was hoping you would actually
sorry

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,970
can target I was hoping you'd stay dark
and gloomy in here because James King is

6
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,270
going to be talking to us about

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,920
dungeon generation techniques for
robotics in Python so it can be ground

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,370
robot

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,370
alright think you are

10
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,760
for settlers like to thank the park on
organizers for putting on such a great

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,160
event

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,510
thirty-year running coming to the event
and it's just been really well

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,180
bigger and better every year an awfully
think the volunteers for

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,650
run smoothly us a bit about me happen if
I come programmer

15
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:08,120
since a 2006 professionally but some I
really expenses go back on we have a

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,170
2004

17
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,729
I am my day job is mostly

18
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,909
telephone operations with applications
systems storage

19
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,580
things like that but at night ira

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,360
weekly D&D group every Sunday and I
liked it up design dungeons

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,040
I also have poured my heart and soul
into thousands of hours a broke likes

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,540
I'm who hears played any sort road bike
games

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,030
good crowd saucer you know like

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,670
Road that hack Korea and Banton

25
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,400
on my personal favorites dungeon crawl
Stone Soup and

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,380
in order to get a better player
eventually maybe if you're also a

27
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,250
program reserved in the source code

28
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,020
figure how to make levels workplace
economies things like that so

29
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,750
I'm today's talk is primarily about
designing

30
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,830
procedurally generated content for games
I say designing

31
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,930
because I when people think maybe random

32
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,000
generated levels if they don't think
I've Lake carefully crafted gameplay

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,129
experiences

34
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:13,629
and they don't think they think maybe
like it's just gonna look the same after

35
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:14,930
a while so it's gonna be

36
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,660
aqui here but in my

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,480
adventures in in exploring the robotic
space in reply development of come

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,540
across many ideas

39
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,680
I think akroyd sure if you today

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,629
so the first step baby staff is how do
we represent

41
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,640
attention in a computer and for our
purposes today we're just talking

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,210
aerobics for two-dimensional

43
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,340
top-down I'm trials

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,740
I think we paper you might think cruelty
in the tiles

45
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,850
one common way of representing them in
Python

46
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,210
is usefulness to do to readers construct
I

47
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,590
list lists the server

48
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,860
very hey we're approaching and we

49
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,660
get our left and we use two indices to
index into our

50
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,350
dungeon and look at the different tiles
that are there

51
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,319
I one approach that I like is

52
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,550
packing everything to multi-dimensional
array into a single list

53
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,230
found sort house he lays out its a
reason memory in

54
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,670
budgetary multi-dimensional arrays as a
single array as he gets just listed in

55
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,720
economic numbers

56
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,290
and you can index into it as if it is a
multidimensional array

57
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,410
isaacson cover major artery which looks
kinda like this

58
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,730
and if you can imagine each

59
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,870
row I love the grid being laid out one
after the other in the street

60
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,720
linear array that's basically what this
and excellent you get into each

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,290
part by giving action why I usually do
with a library wrote a while ago to get

62
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,650
help me out write some

63
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,160
journals and things like that called
Horton I guess you agree to our church

64
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,030
and then you can just into action to the
greasy from their ex-wives

65
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,230
a pattern in think so

66
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,310
first steps with random little
generation armies

67
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,750
I think it's a good start for anybody is
interested in getting into this topic

68
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,209
the reason being that they're very very
easy went but there are a lot of them

69
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,280
and its seeing a result very quickly on
the screen out the first kind here's an

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,329
example of the

71
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,139
depth first search backtracking
Jefferson child

72
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:25,849
I'm what you do is you just start off at
a random point summer in your grid

73
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,050
and do you start searching as far as you
can

74
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,379
until you hit and to the new backtrack

75
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:36,190
and start going as deep as you can again
it's worried if its name

76
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,880
and c2c like oh there's a little bit a
helper code in the background that I

77
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,400
have explained here just for

78
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,990
I was just where it's at the core of the
algorithm their

79
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,160
sister of a stack and

80
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,270
occurred sell you choose randomly from
you're starting grid

81
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm the cells by the way are the
elements inside you're already there

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,610
I just make them like notation ritual
objects that have for

83
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:06,080
walls I guess and basically we're in a
tunnel through each cell as weak as we

84
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,020
come across so

85
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,110
we start of a forced acknowledge the
limits in the stack

86
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,340
we just get the incident neighbors for a
current cell

87
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,380
if there are some great we take a

88
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,110
a random choice from those neighbors
removable wall between the current cell

89
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,540
phone that

90
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,169
at random even we selected so-and-so for
sandwiches appended the consulate attack

91
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:32,910
choose and so forth when a camera
happening is that you get to

92
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,490
the a place where there are no new
neighbors in accys

93
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,090
and interest are popping things office
back backtracking to get

94
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,340
I'm well getting too much details
approved for anything like that this

95
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,430
alan's guarantee to touch every single
cell

96
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,830
in your grid and then you end up with a
measly

97
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,240
this was a long line between recorders

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,590
different example I just contrast the
different methods available Scott Prince

99
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,900
algorithm

100
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,419
the Wikipedia definition scudder dance
I'm

101
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,580
reforms it so this is a formatting a
minimum spanning tree

102
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,080
for connected undirected weighted graph

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,510
defines a subset of edges the connective
rivers

104
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,470
implementation I miss little bit more

105
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,540
dense than the tougher search

106
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,940
but if anybody seen you star search
algorithm

107
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,139
looks kinda like that we have a frontier
cells you haven't visited yet you have

108
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,650
and interior number cells are you have
and TVs we keep adding

109
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,240
I'm new cells to from the frontier into
your interior cells and adding new

110
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,800
neighbors

111
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,830
exactly because interspace

112
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,900
on so what's really interesting there's
that

113
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,479
just by switching the younger than we
get two different designs for maize

114
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,199
that's really the first nah we can just
as in encoders designers

115
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,479
levels is in these games is that I'm
because tweet the album GRMN

116
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,650
triggers results to notice in the Des
for search it was a very their long two

117
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,040
corners I find that

118
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,660
in order to find as a player like which
branches are not worth following

119
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,220
you have to come to follow it a little
bit your eye or as you're playing before

120
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,699
you can tell jurors about branches

121
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,750
whereas with the Prince our own version
got lot of short little tiny

122
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,440
quarters in a very blocky sorta look
which makes it easy to tell which the

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,220
differences are right off the bat

124
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,720
but I'm because it's so dense looking at
blocking looking it's actually kinda

125
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,570
little bit hard to sort of see that
flowing movement through the level

126
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:36,910
hours a day for surgery fixer gives away
the star position start sleeping

127
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,009
but we're not here to talk me amazes
specifically am

128
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:44,130
at a higher level we want to generate
levels for games tensions

129
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,370
and there are many many approaches to
doing this one

130
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,520
more naive ones i've seen I'm one of the
ones I think are a great place to start

131
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,199
and a teacher just how complex you can
get

132
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,860
is gonna open grid I love

133
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,580
just walls and I make one random room
inside that creating a place it

134
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,740
somewhere randomly inside

135
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,389
got one room place on the map now and my
next step would be to choose one of the

136
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:12,490
walls

137
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,470
I would take out from that while I'm
start scanning ahead until I could find

138
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,199
enough room to place the next room on my
list

139
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,460
and then if I can I place at room
connect them up

140
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,580
keep going you can have branch you
looking

141
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,580
dungeons works work like interconnected

142
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,729
hallways are some but

143
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,919
Tom other that can waste a lot of effort
cuz there's a lot of cases and there's

144
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,360
backtracking there some checks things
are going to have to do

145
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,170
I wanna show you today is a technique
that

146
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,440
I will guarantee that you won't overlap
in your room so you don't have to do any

147
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,899
searching

148
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,200
and it generates levels pretty fast
called

149
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,709
from of first reserve the data
structures I'm kinda review for those

150
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:00,580
who

151
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,820
have been in computer science for maybe
you haven't seen this before her

152
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,709
relatively new to programming by a
binary tree is essentially

153
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:11,220
Pfizer notes likely to be a empty

154
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,420
or be consist of a route with two binary

155
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,240
trees so it's a non-linear structure it
forms a tree initial

156
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,930
Michael clear for them is left right I'm

157
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,220
so and so forth we're not we're not
concerned level design with

158
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,380
balancing the trees or anything like
that were mainly concerned with

159
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,529
space partitioning was a space
partitioning algorithm

160
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,360
we start off with an open grid we split
it into

161
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,500
randomly horizontally vertically where
we split it

162
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,920
you know we can could be anywhere in
there and then we worker summer some

163
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,550
parts

164
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,050
and so on the left side we've split that
went into horizontally and we keep going

165
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,580
to reach either

166
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,450
I'm maximum to or I minimum size for the
space is depending on how we want to

167
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,870
terminate the offer

168
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,110
us for the Golden Rule recursion always
have jewish commission up front

169
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,160
once we have bad have much relief now
it's meant to replace all the rooms

170
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,470
kind of interesting and the rooms
overlap guaranteed

171
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,520
I once we have all the rooms in the leaf
nodes I'm

172
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,200
this is where you want to look up some
the I'm

173
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,260
by her tree traversal

174
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,709
methods because we want to go up through
tree in level order

175
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,649
so going from lowest widest part in the
tree up through

176
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:36,029
and connect all the speakers together at
each level

177
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,750
as a guarantee that all the reserve
actually connected

178
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,940
I am some people in mind talks to listen
to nasa so

179
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,430
course I'm noises cover stickers
actually two parts to that

180
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,480
I could decide which and turns out that
power and practice for a bit of a gap of

181
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,950
time to talk to cover them

182
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,250
doubt but what I did mean was poised
time

183
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,380
discs Perlin noise

184
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,330
and sell your Armada is ur I'll mixer
techniques for

185
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,920
placing things and also for generating
different types

186
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,120
of train fare levels for example silly
raw tomato their

187
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,680
Conway's Game of Life everyone from
there to roughly

188
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,779
so you have an initial state have some
cells are on some other of me a couple

189
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,670
rules for turning on/off

190
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,160
based on a occurrence to next year's
refutations about

191
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,440
and you get keeps time

192
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,990
cooking cape systems I am place on

193
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,769
discs I'll that is taking a

194
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:39,000
distribution of points insider for to
the spacers

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,480
artificial space per for to the space
I'll

196
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,440
where all the points are equidistant to
each other based on some minimal

197
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,029
distance space flight so that's really
need cuz you can use that to

198
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,769
likes a fine job rooms where you want to
place

199
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:58,790
special features different enemies

200
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,790
bosses things like that keys whatnot

201
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,750
kind of I could be used for other
nefarious purposes we're on

202
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,300
minimum distances are being equal could
be use you can use a preliminaries

203
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,720
function there

204
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,110
Minister king tartikoff to reheat
together and graphics we use that to you

205
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,279
do things like place petition

206
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,519
for example Picasa probably doing it
gives here

207
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,110
Perlin noise I'm Spurs we want folks on
simplex nice for games just cuz it's a

208
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,310
little bit more efficient than the
original

209
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:35,190
growing algorithm that generates most
cloudy

210
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,149
textures answer each cell have agreed in
Crowle unit based on

211
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:43,720
all the other cells green values into
the histogram those

212
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,329
and if you have a %uh interval function
iserror takes like a high end of a fact

213
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:49,600
you can't have

214
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,930
pits and things like that tear four
points with his plea

215
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,209
broke awesome roguelike

216
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,760
I'm it has what a cool little pet a brat
bridges that span bombing

217
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,839
and things like that finally

218
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,360
I'm one of the more interesting things I
saw

219
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,600
presented at GDC effect last year was

220
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,720
using constraint solvers for game design

221
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,060
so constraint solving problem is

222
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,100
where you have he punch

223
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,310
love variables whose values could be

224
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,019
within a certain range a computer
continuous for discrete

225
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,180
continues being sorta like a for a
corner like

226
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,579
I'm going over that never has a separar
fine art thing was just a sec

227
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:39,690
have numbers like a fixed settler

228
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,760
there's no I'm I'm we want to focus on
finite domains

229
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,310
for games it's a lot faster it's a lot
easier because in

230
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,170
constraint solving problems is are
really large search spaces lot known in

231
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,640
Pekan

232
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,029
Inc np-complete problems in their I'm if
you try to make it perfect so

233
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:00,300
the fortunate thing is that we're I'm
with games without constraint solvers

234
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,519
we can come up with

235
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,570
an algorithm that is specifically
tailored to our problem space

236
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,760
and we can cut away invalid branches
research base before we get

237
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,899
too far so naive version of a constraint
solver will

238
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,209
look at all the variables and try to
reach all the way down and check

239
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:22,529
every possible value from every
combination

240
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,589
hand we can do little bit better

241
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:29,639
so what does it look like what's
involved in constraint so

242
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,940
solver well you have first a variable

243
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,339
games more than one usually the have

244
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:41,190
a each variable has a demeanor values

245
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,630
and first thing you need is a constraint

246
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,410
on the tix one or two variables and

247
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,470
enforces the constraint on them so think
of the a queens problem you've got

248
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,060
anybody play chess a religious some
people put receive

249
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,839
probably fairly familiar with what a
queen does on a board placed on a board

250
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,990
and the Queen's problem on a place a
different by

251
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,540
none other Queens replace can be in a
position where they could be attacked by

252
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,279
a quick

253
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,389
I'm on so the thing about this kinda
constraint problem in

254
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,709
dungeon design its more a very well I've
got all these rooms here's the exit I

255
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,870
don't want I don't care where the
impasse is but i wanna be with in one

256
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,310
room at the exit

257
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,870
I'm I have all these monsters the place
they could be placed newsrooms

258
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:33,209
and I want to make sure that the room
after this one has a health potion

259
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:37,690
ok exactly which one has what bo those
constraints must be satisfied in order

260
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,290
for this to be a good room

261
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:45,070
from hiking and so

262
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,180
we can do that biking she was on the
call dark

263
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,000
consistency so I'm instead of the naive
way of searching all the way through

264
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,440
every possible value in the domains for
all the variables ago saying before

265
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,630
in the Queen's problem you might say
well we don't need to search any role

266
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,980
column or tag know what we push the
Queen and Mac

267
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,050
placing there's no future possible
configuration where

268
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,470
placing aqui ni Spartans going to make a
balanced solution so sick norrell

269
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,130
on and

270
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,680
and

271
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,670
our consistency were going one step
further saying listen that while many

272
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,790
dollars possible eyes across all the
variables

273
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,480
often constrained personals for all the
times that also means come smaller

274
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,350
research narrow down the demands for
each variable

275
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,170
as we go along until each variable has a
single unique value

276
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,560
and once we have all that we know that
we have about solutions we can use a

277
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,290
slow

278
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,880
how I would have a car like in Python
welts actually

279
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,480
not too hard to implement a very naive
version of this

280
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,690
I am just to learn about the general
problem she was and how to go about

281
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,440
so we might start raising a variable
class is

282
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,380
producer your eyes

283
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,850
if you're actually using is unreal
engine you might actually you probably

284
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,240
should use a bit mask for

285
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,449
for used faster

286
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,189
each variable hands he Nero function

287
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,250
and the narrow just takes

288
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,539
a new set of values answered with the
current set of values

289
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,689
and then you'll see some weird returns
through this kernel get to that in a

290
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:27,049
minute

291
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:32,059
but the idea is that if we have values
that article the new values

292
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:35,879
that'll save business again another
optimization step

293
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:38,659
were implemented on Tuesday but the
important parts the folks at the bottom

294
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:39,950
there

295
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,259
and so we gotta reach constraints in the
concerns variables

296
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:47,039
involving we propagate the new values up
the constraint

297
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,210
and constrain base class is actually
fairly

298
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,979
nice small this is entirely a

299
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:58,590
I just has to have offices variables to
request

300
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,529
and a property acid has been committed
somehow

301
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:05,779
to propagate message is responsible for
taking the new certifies propagating

302
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:07,389
that out all the available

303
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:11,109
constrain as a from a

304
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:14,989
sir sonny's ok posh I'm

305
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:18,009
the from ipod propaganda from
hypothetical inequalities

306
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:22,299
string nothing too special there were
saying that

307
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:24,929
when we've got a new variable if the
variables you need to make sure we

308
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,320
remove it from all your

309
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
possible constrain players so this

310
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,210
variable X very quiet can ever have the
same to sticker

311
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,779
unique for

312
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,350
was worried it the summer the the
excuses we have to handle

313
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,299
so this offer just as the next look
through to make sure that all once I

314
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:45,489
have all my variables

315
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:49,190
have unique value i cant stop turn my
values

316
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,830
however decide to do that are you want
to have someone to stack management in

317
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,309
there

318
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:57,989
as an optimization step I'm

319
00:18:57,989 --> 00:19:01,389
there could be a point where I'll

320
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:05,479
you get to know her I'm a very much
narrowed

321
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:09,289
down 27 which is involved problem can't
be

322
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:13,419
ever reach a solution so what we can do
is implement

323
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,710
stack that remembers where

324
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,159
I'm each value changes in variable jury

325
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,190
cycle and

326
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,359
do those appear forget invalid states
that we can try

327
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,850
maybe again 100 I am doing things

328
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,729
lost connection I think some people over
here

329
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:39,759
so is the optimizations to make this
problem tenable I'm in Python you want

330
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,220
to make sure the representative basques

331
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,609
you want implemented undo stack I'll

332
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:49,669
you want to use and when you're actually
composing your problems you try wanna

333
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:51,029
try to use as many

334
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:54,330
or as few summers few variables as
possible and

335
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,619
stay within if I scrutiny as much as you
can

336
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:03,739
for a safe thanks again let me just talk
com

337
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:09,019
I really hoped to you some more games
using these techniques because

338
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:12,700
I actor large more space to explore

339
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,979
and I really hope that there are more
road bikes written in Python

340
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:20,019
future I'm Cesar summer

341
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:23,479
valuable resources are found time are

342
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:26,950
worth working out particularly had a
bill to construe proper gear

343
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,259
weekend really good papers that was what
was presented at GDC last year

344
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:36,539
there's a are quicker on some person
took sampling these two books

345
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,690
sometimes book for agree

346
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,889
I'm if you wanna quote and start making
your own road bike games

347
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:46,970
out specifically the Dorian library
provides a lot of support that area

348
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,440
the sea possible I bernard has a nice
Python interface I'm gives you actually

349
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,690
a

350
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:55,729
Beyer Speed partition tree I'm to total
levels with as well as other things like

351
00:20:55,729 --> 00:21:00,159
lighting and other literacy when
implement parts by a little after that

352
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:00,820
I've been using

353
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,190
doctoring a little bit for some mind
about demos

354
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,059
the researcher stock and crushed by game
time

355
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,580
there's I'm so think

356
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,769
I might actually went a little too fast
but free

357
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:18,409
nope Florida questions

358
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:25,409
me go

359
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:34,090
a ton hoops

360
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:41,090
sign nerves

361
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,330
a I don't think I can today
unfortunately

362
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:56,330
sorry

363
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,340
as a list this I will be uploading on
with all your

364
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,310
talks live you get those winter and you
shortly specific patterns lies but

365
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:13,140
Hotpoint resources try anything with
thanks

366
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,680
adjoining thing with multi-user dungeons
multiple players in a dungeon

367
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,860
they grow the dungeons it each player
gross tons in different places and

368
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,190
trying to unify them in

369
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,660
that's our thing rain I haven't yet

370
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,710
about a I've been studying broke source
code very closely

371
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,470
really cool so that that

372
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,670
that means like keeping track if you can
start doing pets

373
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,880
and broke for example you can actually
go to the agent go over

374
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,210
fall down and go to a new level of
attention and

375
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,140
so it just kinda making us for
consistent you imagine putting layers

376
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,570
and layers the single sheets min

377
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,100
remover talked earlier holes go

378
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,110
my now you keep falling are you hit
something

379
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,350
I

380
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,800
arm it on the

381
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,500
slider you were talking about building
the like the capabilities of

382
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,650
each room and what not that to keep the
constraints and

383
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:16,810
undo stack it seemed to me that you
could run into a scenario where

384
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,890
it was in a possible problem how to you
war

385
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,930
work around a like

386
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,310
racist so another optimization technique
is to make sure that you only implement

387
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,270
constraints for computationally feasible

388
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,300
you can get in a situation

389
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,940
in general contrs like search problems
of this nature

390
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,420
tend to be I'm exponential

391
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,660
in the general case the journal
worst-case which is why

392
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,840
we're trying to kill the algorithms to
with things but if you're

393
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,840
coming for the constraint can't be Sol

394
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,830
at a tricky problem you have to try and
avoid clichés

395
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,570
down there are many strategies to by
first checking that constrains could be

396
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,620
solved you can run this

397
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,600
Nelson as per haven't gone to just yet

398
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,940
but there's a good no threat include a
link to

399
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,570
larger labs library has assault her
already built in part for me

400
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,860
experiment with and

401
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,500
and see all times just kind of running
after a while to say one quick after

402
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,460
this and trying

403
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:34,460
strategy

404
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,730
how how you arm worked

405
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:43,010
the like how would implementing

406
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,850
or using these techniques be better then

407
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,200
saying spend spend a a weekend or so
when

408
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,720
creating and prefab

409
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,770
rooms and and and and hallways and then

410
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,810
just shuffling them and

411
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:06,380
connecting them together yeah I'm that's
very popular technique coming down

412
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,670
across as a hobby have

413
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,990
sort of Sammy constructed thing to the
dungeon the connector

414
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:17,660
star bound as a where their Dutch
generations actually 2d side-scrolling

415
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,440
but

416
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,130
Somerset a lot of the same techniques
apply for these pre constructed bits and

417
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,220
connect them all together

418
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,760
I think it's more of a style preference
where you want

419
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,530
like a hand constructed made sure that
it looks like this type of experience

420
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,310
whereas the constraints offers more be I
really

421
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,700
care what it looks like as long as it
remains within these parameters

422
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,270
I can I'm so it's more of a stylistic
choice

423
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:47,690
you can make you mix the two for sure hi

424
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,100
thank you whassup um just to mention a
few things I've been

425
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,820
having fun with I'm also working on a
procedurally generated game

426
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,250
on in my case some making a became the
second to these other

427
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,570
the game boy para and I have the great
advantage that there are already

428
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,850
existing the other games

429
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,970
so in my case have had a ton of luck
with Markov chains

430
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,180
arm for those not familiar the mark
chains are basically finite state

431
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,900
machines

432
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,530
a except instead of having heart set
rules to move between states

433
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,540
you have probabilistic transitions that
is state aim at heaven

434
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,010
eighty percent chance meters TB or 3
percent in something to STC

435
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,090
and you couldn't do look ahead on cell
so you can have one cell

436
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,480
I look ahead Markov chain or two
self-worth reseller

437
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,040
hover crazy you want to be so with even
one or two cells to get really nice

438
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,810
results

439
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:39,740
in generating landscape things like that
so of course you have to have

440
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,450
on existing data but on just something
about you can have fun

441
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,210
kinda making simple rooms and running
Markov chains on those to see what Jenna

442
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,420
what gets generated

443
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,900
on and about the previous

444
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,160
questioners idea doing prefabs

445
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,960
for the viewer from there the games
belong key and there's an article online

446
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,200
that kinda explains how they did it and
they did it

447
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,430
in a way similar to that by just having
prefabricated rooms

448
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:09,060
a few dozen her world in an arranging
them in different ways and having

449
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,580
constraints on them like mentioned

450
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,040
and you get real Nationals on that so
there's definitely a

451
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,450
a large body of were above work are in

452
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,430
generating content procedurally and it's
worth looking into

453
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,790
aerobic bro basins a very good genetic
resource for a lot of those kinds of

454
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,460
articles

455
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,070
on Kingdom Donna things like that star
about guys also have

456
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,450
your blog post but I'd prefabs thanks to
talk

457
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,970
picture II may do it

458
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,840
I need to get something presentable
running and I might dueling tana yes

459
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,200
28

460
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,370
more games and play time

461
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,400
so another another question I

462
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,600
have a how would you transition

463
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,610
summer these techniques to generate

464
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,740
3 3d world's

465
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,450
or generate or layered dungeons

466
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,570
up door fortress

467
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,100
world comes to mind right so a lot of
the

468
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,400
our group so mentioned are international
generalize

469
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,890
higher like on

470
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,330
the price index disc slashing

471
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,740
a lot of noise over those even

472
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,910
its even something as little as how you
store all your

473
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,190
cubes are knows a river in three
dimensions

474
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,750
I'm so those

475
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,950
hours will scale up with you when you go
up to

476
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,470
three dimensions things about like
minecraft for example

477
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,870
use no noise generation technique to
curb the

478
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,090
caves your

479
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:00,560
interpolation went so the silly
automatic thing to do for dinner in case

480
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,000
you can

481
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,620
interpolate maps over to my over top of
each other side you can like some

482
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,980
to crime police or affect parts of your
dungeon so thinking with

483
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,590
the Perlin noise generator kinda take
the

484
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,930
the only the highest values above a
certain threshold and use those cells

485
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:21,040
as see pits Arkiv sir

486
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,850
just floor just comical Mangion

487
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:31,850
like it's sort of sad be destroyed

488
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,850
crew

489
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:43,850
tons talking's all day

490
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:52,110
I'll try to repeat the question ok

491
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,880
so more on the on the generation

492
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,390
up three worlds ish

493
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,420
have you generated

494
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,720
any sort of I am ruins kinda

495
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,240
like more over like variations on the

496
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,740
on on on rooms structure

497
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,660
maybe using like creating a room and
destroying it a little bit

498
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,270
reading it right so you might use a
noise function can destroy a little bit

499
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,570
or change the tiles

500
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,760
with the price on

501
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,340
disc sampling and using the Perlin noise

502
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,840
to cost for the the toss together things
are gonna visitation placement

503
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,370
things like that and

504
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,429
for feature selection you have

505
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:53,790
to construe property make sure that

506
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,910
like this aqueduct flows through

507
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:02,590
rooms and is always connected and have
used

508
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,169
the this these techniques

509
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:09,799
for map generation I for

510
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,910
like generating other sort of content

511
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,640
maybe creatures generation I haven't
touched on creature generation or

512
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,000
anything

513
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,570
astoria it's mainly from maps from

514
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,360
with a little creativity could be
explained

515
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,840
expenditure that area research Korea

516
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,970
and just out of curiosity

517
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:36,280
what's water the dimensions of the most
complex

518
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,780
map toward the one that you feel that
most prouder

519
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,070
that you've generated I am

520
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,480
there's a new technique for the poison
disks sampling the king at SIGGRAPH

521
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,600
like 2006 and it introduces a new a very
special it is a structure

522
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,100
specialty structure for fast sampling
that's actually pretty slow oven

523
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,940
but it does have a very fast sampling
like them

524
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,150
like seventeen house in eighteen
thousand points

525
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,309
on a very large image a pretty quickly

526
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:16,309
really quickly actually report within
seconds really talking to you general

527
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:24,090
hospital

528
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:33,720
would

529
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,250
him

530
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,809
good

531
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:43,570
it

532
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:43,820
you
