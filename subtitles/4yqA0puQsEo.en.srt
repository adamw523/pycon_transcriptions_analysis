00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:14,880
hello

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,099
hi are so we have a show in your county
from India

3
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:25,099
today and she's gonna speak to us about
won't hurt others had me on disconnect

4
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:32,099
thank you please welcome us

5
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,760
hi everyone I

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,820
thanks for coming to the stock %uh mean
and disconnect is actually

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,940
a song by Porcupine Tree I did not make
up the good name myself

8
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,230
a this dog is about a

9
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,670
a happy eyeballs a guarded them that
implemented interested

10
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,449
edited boring guy the hostname important
I

11
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,010
today in this dog I'm gonna talk about
all the

12
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,210
Catholic a think programming mistakes
that I made

13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,699
to do it and no how to do things right

14
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,190
though you can do them right from the
get-go and a

15
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,560
hopefully you'll also get a themself

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,509
the amazingly awesome community that

17
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,590
blistered hands an Abergavenny

18
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,080
I'm studying computer science and money
by India

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,340
and I'll lately I've been working on a

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,850
%eh be BM God hippie that that

21
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,050
implementation and by well

22
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,530
happy I bought I implemented this
because it sounded good

23
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,820
no I'm lying I implemented those because
everyone kept telling me that

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,320
it's a crazy complicated and buying

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,950
and

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,780
and on up if you're not be you bite out
to be 100

27
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,179
vie est belle garden exist and

28
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,469
how it is useful but the BIRT

29
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,500
I really didn't are getting all have
died

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,060
and after implemented still

31
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,050
endpoint interested there API is that to
breed the implementation

32
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,299
up servers and clients from what they're
supposed to do

33
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,670
so up that a client and buying basically

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,640
article updates so has the connect
method that big so

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,810
fact he and other day loans are deferred
fighting with the connected to depart

36
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,980
most important in particular are big to
host name

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,390
resolved addendum I double host
addresses and %ah

38
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,760
you don't the connection to the rules
that is established first

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,459
so the name is illusion by peter is done
by

40
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,630
sockets energy I meant good and

41
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,329
the V this works is that when you pass a
horse named

42
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:54,380
this method it does also into might've
been posted this is redundant mister

43
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,870
those connected the hosts

44
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,920
end a no dead

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,290
these addresses can be ipv4 ipv6

46
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,340
what this means for us is bad I am

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,840
then you want to connect whatsoever you

48
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,230
need to identify it but then address so

49
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,180
a ipv4 is the therefore division of

50
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,790
Internet Protocol and uses it could be
due bird addressing scheme

51
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,359
this gives this arm just over $2.4
billion

52
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,430
addresses but they aren't allowed though

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,959
there as expanding so fast that this

54
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,359
is not enough you started running
charter practices know that's why I B

55
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:36,510
six comes in

56
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,220
and saves the day basically it uses 128
bit

57
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,430
addressing scheme and a gives us many
many more

58
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,049
addison's and a the long-term goal is to
transition to work completely

59
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,849
eventually bike it up

60
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,680
I mean might be fought applications do
prefer ipv6 because after all it's the

61
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,010
internet up the future

62
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,349
bike don't start that although some most
of the applications have this

63
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:10,209
ipv6 addresses be balloon art book
properly in the servers

64
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,489
so if %uh servers a ipv4 by Tim Berg on
a looking but ipv6 connectivity is

65
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,079
impaired

66
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,789
though body is ipv6 capable applications
like

67
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:25,210
their browsers email clients on the
those word

68
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,880
arm let's see they would

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,020
in got a few seconds I believe not to
Genzyme

70
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,070
don't know how long it big but yeah
April a incurs some delay

71
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,390
before falling bach to ipv4 and

72
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,250
back harms though application
performance then

73
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,580
users a experience with ipv6

74
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,890
and it slows down a doctor bins and

75
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,469
dots a problem so happy eyeball to guard
them

76
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:57,669
solves this problem for us it say is
that

77
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,830
once we have the list of resolved whose
dad this is

78
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,090
we should a connect who work in the
order in which they are

79
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,789
don't endo you're done the connection

80
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:13,210
that established first this means that
we are trying to connect to multiple

81
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,330
hosts

82
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,080
who showed us is that was returned to us
but the thing is that

83
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,810
okay initially when I heard the song by
them I thought that okay maybe

84
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,849
what be you going to do here
disconnected the first address and

85
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:33,000
a regard how long back ok then the next
Addison the less regard how long dark BX

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,530
then compare the two dimes and then
probably

87
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,460
a the one-dot eggs less a bank and it
back one

88
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,460
but I was very wrong are what happens
here

89
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,570
though high-level objective of the
SunGard them is

90
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,479
do I returned a connection ass quickly
as possible

91
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,800
and up the VI the example that I just

92
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,950
explain used pecan expand that would be
a lot of time

93
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,620
so what do you do is be the the
initiated several connections

94
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,500
in badelain and then the one that
connects posters were done by the others

95
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,140
are dropped

96
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,560
bike another objective abyss

97
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,930
a guide them and Latino and bind because
you're starting to talk about then point

98
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,089
is do a is to basically you

99
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,250
seve network resources and

100
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,200
if the first host addresses connection

101
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,029
is establish quick enough there could be
a beast of follow-up

102
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:36,990
resources to connect to other areas as
well

103
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,089
so we introduce a $300 million secondly

104
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:44,779
that means third we don't actually
initiate all the connections together

105
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,149
the subsequent connections are

106
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,599
initiated up here a little bit be so now
moving

107
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:57,320
on up a missus and mister ten-point and
be wanting to balance things in it how

108
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,409
do we do that

109
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:01,690
listed as any synchronous Iran given
night looking for a book

110
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,849
and I just want balance things

111
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:08,339
so well the good news is that the state
is good i doing

112
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,969
badly things especially deleted network
operations

113
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:16,399
the reactor that busted reactor

114
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,459
is good doing might build things at once

115
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:24,180
by doing multiple things I mean that
Bates formidable think that once

116
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,750
and that its job essentially

117
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,789
so what happened here is that connect
PCB

118
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:34,990
returns immediately it doesn't babe for
the connection to actually be

119
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,430
established

120
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:42,269
it just Rick dunce initiates the process
of starting a TCP connection

121
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:45,680
and then returns adeptly and a

122
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,690
the reactor caused this method F

123
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,969
bend the connection is finally done an
established

124
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:57,320
so that back to me the been you to
specify a call back back would be God

125
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,300
led the do so let me know that the
connection is done

126
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,450
now the second part of that are the
members about

127
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,419
should willingly both the early October
the method by

128
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,519
gone leader does this for us and

129
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,130
in this your basically should you link
the

130
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,479
a applied to the function F after 5
seconds

131
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,159
so that's what bag does and now that I
knew that

132
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,659
what I needed to do and that was to
growers capable of letting me do this

133
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,950
I love being too hard to write unit
tests for this

134
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,149
because the spec is kind of complicated

135
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,269
and the only way to know if viv done it
right

136
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,289
is do bill would the as

137
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,440
driven development be so the first thing
that

138
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,149
I needed to know was should I use the
word he acted in the best

139
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,640
are not so what happens here is bad um

140
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,209
but I did this the early October
actually

141
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:04,130
tries to better delivered the operating
system event in real-time

142
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,459
doctor that stone avoid by the but

143
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:10,800
beauty testing UN unit testing
especially

144
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,580
V should limit are going docked with
external word

145
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,589
as much as possible and the actor
doesn't do that for us said

146
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:22,700
just it is the means to talk to the
outside world

147
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,220
and me to avoid that so

148
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,260
don't be gone do this that's wrong but
not long but

149
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,310
thats not advisable I T so

150
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,019
there's a SW guide Clark interested

151
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,200
died on what does the same thing bag

152
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,240
a we were going to test for dinner got

153
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,510
up it how the gonadal mattered bag a
third

154
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,829
should you've delayed called and it has
I'll

155
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:53,240
a method got a good month so what's
happening here is my belly

156
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,050
clock initiative you're telling it that
okay this is the function that I want to

157
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,730
gone after five seconds and then second

158
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,420
you're saying that okay here I want to
know what would happen if packwood bonds

159
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,690
by fights against

160
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,200
what about event will take place on
basically triggers

161
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,320
the third it's like I aim is frozen and
yeah I bonds in the clock

162
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,190
I'm as as in how we like so

163
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,380
now moving on to the and implementation

164
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,930
I didn't have a name for this it doesn't
always go Idaho standpoint

165
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,110
so we had a discussion about that the
first edition

166
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,340
was hostname endpoint because it big
whose name

167
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,870
an the next word or whatever purple
colours

168
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,340
appropriate the next addition misty CBN
white

169
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,490
mostly because we hadn't used the name
yet but

170
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,640
a also because it the

171
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,800
dog connection was established by RTT

172
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,290
but the thing is a host names are not
parts

173
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,560
BC they are not even part if I P

174
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,250
they are about to be in it and on
ninety-nine percent though

175
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,240
this endpoints mentality was the NS so

176
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,800
BNs and buying but then again

177
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,820
a BNs can be used to resolve names

178
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,780
for other things as well and this
endpoint won't let us do that

179
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:23,530
its its just to establish connections to
servers and clients using BCP

180
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,670
so this name wasn't right either so

181
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,420
the important thing to remember here is
docked a

182
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,610
ECP NBN as the girl implementation

183
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,370
implementation details that important
implementation details

184
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,460
but nevertheless the I dot so

185
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,780
what we need to remember about this and
buying is that it be true was named

186
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:51,710
and the next do it gives us the
connection sold them and point it was

187
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,900
now moving on to the implementation a

188
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,250
I had no idea how to go about that it
was even if

189
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,870
I did understand the spec after a lot of

190
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,800
I dunno speculation it it makes sense

191
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,570
but I had no idea where to start so a

192
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,200
john paul was my mentor during mice deal
with some other food project

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,590
would I was doing around the same time
suggested a few simple steps to get

194
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,300
started

195
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,480
the first one is this listing its
feeders

196
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,550
on a piece of paper are a txt file

197
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,279
something something next we're starting
them

198
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,990
now a idea behind starting it from the
simplest dude

199
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,570
the most complex is that I'd

200
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,850
the complicating things are only
complicated than you tried on

201
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,060
do them honored once so if you first
finish

202
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,120
implementing are dealing with the simple

203
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,350
pings are simple parts of then buying
then

204
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,200
the complicated but don't seem to want
to get enough to draw

205
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,110
so bob was the second step well with her
grandmother died in your dust

206
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,340
for the first thing in that list that's
made sense because

207
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,600
I already talked about is driven
development

208
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,490
so coming together lighting best part

209
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,510
okay before that on then a

210
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,900
now I'm going to this doubt all the
different mistake that I made to out

211
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,920
this endpoints development

212
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,210
the first one was that then I was trying
to implemented

213
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,950
I was trying to catch the failure

214
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,120
that was supposed to it bill in an
exception

215
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,220
in it in an acceptable Aug and I had a
unit test for this

216
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,610
and it was feeling and I was

217
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,210
kind of confused about what was
happening and turns out

218
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,820
its its the movie that de foods book

219
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,770
what do you do with like a lot the first
line with the word it forward

220
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,860
I'll give me a connection and

221
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,330
the death would be good fire but the got
back on it

222
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,670
I dinner back the important thing here
is that B is rebuilding

223
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,200
and the bay by two functions work is
back a

224
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,330
you can either get done are you can
raise but you can I bought

225
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,500
and since it was returning something
there was

226
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,740
the sting was wrong the right thing to
do here would have been this

227
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,350
we could have us top 10 i Barack where
back over girl

228
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,820
overdid effort and I would do the air
handling finance

229
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,290
this first the first mistake I meet and
alone

230
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,040
something out of it second one than you
think is driven development

231
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,210
this is the back like is opposed to get

232
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,970
a first you write the best that fields
then implement the feeder

233
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,540
and the best spots you like another
guess that feels

234
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,920
you implement another feature and things
bus

235
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,080
but the back in that I was getting was
this

236
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,529
and it was beard

237
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,390
by a on my best to had one thing in
common

238
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,430
bacteria residing at a time arguing the

239
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,810
run it was the last night the mistake
that was doing here

240
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,510
is bad I was rebuilding a good effort
from the deaths

241
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,529
i've a store they're doing best what's
been the bill but mister B actor

242
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:20,800
and we don't want to do that

243
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,260
for reasons that I had mentioned before
that reactor is a means to connect with

244
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,339
outside Boyd

245
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:32,100
man Espino mister Diack up nobody out
there what it does is add rice to

246
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,640
again panicked about a boy and
third-best

247
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,940
week for some message to come back from
there

248
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,320
and they'd forever basically but dryer
the twisted best

249
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,870
to a defines forever to be about by

250
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,940
120 seconds I think so it

251
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,990
boers dining out the best for dining out

252
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,380
so the lesson to be learned here is that
we don't want to go and efforts from

253
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,100
tests

254
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,399
we don't want to do that that goes a

255
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,880
then be our dining unit a sec if you to
death

256
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,980
we want to limit how to much be docked
dew

257
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,680
external being its you might keep need
to be

258
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,680
doing this if you're see if your guests
are talking to

259
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,810
the next on a database I think they got

260
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,899
but in even in case you need to do that
you need to remember

261
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,490
a simple basic rule that probably a unit
that shouldn't be talking to

262
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,960
things outside of your application

263
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:38,290
still other something else that I needed
to remember never it never ever getting

264
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,790
efforts from unit tests unless you
really have to

265
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,870
and if you have to just bring you think
the design of your abit

266
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:53,130
okay moving on bill so this is the right
thing to do I just moved back by nine

267
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,580
and on the year thus were busing until
everyone is happy

268
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,670
now I mentioned something God a

269
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,730
dog dog advance in the years lights

270
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,980
I E worse to more for big dick dying

271
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,409
because time is presented as double a
very act dumb

272
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:15,490
the pink is a good so far I was not

273
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,970
dealing with the should be regarded by
to the end point because

274
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,230
remember simple things first complicated
things needed a

275
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,480
still the simple things were working and
everything was going

276
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,679
now I just introduced a single I know

277
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,730
believe God's and my best

278
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,820
very dining out again they were feeling
are sometimes timing out

279
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,210
but not in a way that would tell me what
was going on

280
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,480
so I blame all you do for those because

281
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,260
then I didn't interviews died and my
court up

282
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,429
everything was working II the back and
everything stopped working

283
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,260
and up initially 300 milliseconds was
the

284
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,120
bang that I was using I change that busy
goes against

285
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,250
so that I would know what was going
wrong and years again the immediately

286
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,020
that's like

287
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,789
right now grade I would need to advance
dying for this

288
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:12,090
by a don't sell out I was wrong

289
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,289
I didn't get how all of this was looking

290
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:19,970
so lift who was a the person who died
right to be your game and then ended up

291
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,690
writing twisted instead

292
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,049
a he was helping me a

293
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:28,960
on he was answering my questions and
helping me fix things and then buying

294
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,240
and he said that he courted marty is
from the matrix and

295
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,409
he said that I was thinking too hard
about it he said that

296
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:38,789
it he said it's just a number and no

297
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:42,429
devere clark's call you to my pic books

298
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:46,460
is bad it's art it connects although a
called third

299
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,190
I B over me then sorts them by number

300
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,159
read this number is the time of they
should you got

301
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,239
and then cause them one by one and

302
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:01,989
that Sarda made sense and our

303
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:05,419
Bang Bus frozen but still the US against

304
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:10,309
had be like to hike to bed the clogged
ears again top bud and it is supposed to

305
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,669
move forward now

306
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:14,970
that ok as doubles work and

307
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,149
there that's how things were bare I

308
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:21,379
bid Sardo falling boo

309
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:25,659
more I a I did talk to fall into

310
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:28,869
more Gabbana end up the main

311
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:33,110
even behind all of this with that others
trying to what things together

312
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,779
too high I was trying to understand the
bigger picture and how things fit

313
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:38,129
together

314
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:41,769
even before implemented the smaller
parts a baby I

315
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:44,980
so again this was glyphs idea that

316
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,029
I levy need to stop thinking so hard

317
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:53,879
about those and Eventbrite turns out you
can you would like without knowing by

318
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:57,690
you can most of these are just things
guarding a

319
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,879
other things and end there is no reason
behind it sometimes even

320
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:06,570
its just sunless to think that you need
to

321
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,149
do and the out their needs in order and
the

322
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:13,489
person was implementing it too was a
particular order and

323
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:19,259
that's about it so this help and

324
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,389
not it it was riding behind a nice abie

325
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:25,639
it seem to follow the spate properly

326
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:31,909
but then by the perfect a the only way
to know this was due

327
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:35,929
get it for a good review the be twisted
scored review process books

328
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:40,200
is that a you were going to get you
submit it would review

329
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,690
be booed review it and then they assign
it back to you

330
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,029
you improve it but the comment and he
summitted back in the review

331
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:50,360
any Sunday sometime men it looks good

332
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,460
you get to merge it so

333
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,600
this Holme the connect method for this
endpoint look

334
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,239
it was working but it's like more than
hafer though method are nested

335
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:06,009
and on Dhanbad suggested that

336
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:10,460
connect could possibly be implemented as
an independent object

337
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,809
instead of having so many nested
functions inside even suggested that

338
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,509
in bringing this to finite state machine
would be a great idea

339
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:23,649
if we have a state machine framework for
missed it because it's

340
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:28,179
sold by the way if you're staying for
the Sprint you should diner suggested

341
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:31,929
we can work on this together if that
something

342
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:36,110
so fine a state machines I what's coming
