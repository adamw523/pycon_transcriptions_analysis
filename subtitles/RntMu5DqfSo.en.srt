1
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,850
now see thanks for joining us I'd like
to take moment into Scott Lobdell

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,560
his ass off right here hearsay social
whose reason that they are means we talk

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,669
about this big one pair

4
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:24,669
so get up up

5
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,820
Jeremiah how how have much tightest
thing

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,580
so this is a presentation about blimps I
didn't get the start of right to bear

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,000
with me

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,360
it's one on a clear I

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,729
if not hydrogen out so does get it going
to hell it is going to be really awesome

10
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,850
anyway special about me my name is Scott
Lobdell

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,019
left the army I work for hearsay social
now up

12
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:51,619
I do have some resources for the stock
%uh I did present already have them

13
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,850
posted at the end in sight showed
otherwise we just follow me on twitter

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,920
I have the resources posted online
apollo along if you want

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,699
obviously an outage put in a brief plug
hearsay social is going to be hosting

16
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:02,930
the blimp after party

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,970
the deer to party if you will directly
after this the

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,430
the West End in the our the reserve room

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,750
right I like big names gonna be there
action shots can be there for any fans

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,369
via

21
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,920
at him in his work cell without further
ado let me just go and get into the

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,560
plant here

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,170
so up what this is the semiautonomous
blame

24
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,259
so the idea is that I can incentive
piloting the sting directly I can click

25
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,310
waypoints on a map

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,799
the blimp will navigate to my own goal
for this was to do aerial photography

27
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,649
at so the idea behind this here is that
if any have you want to replicate

28
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:41,210
in your all this project this should
give you enough resources to get started

29
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,439
and to avoid some of the same pitfalls
that I had

30
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,990
so the overall architecture that we have
here is we have a

31
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,270
laptop at has a client application that
in Python

32
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,009
everything is in Python devouring python
skin boots no big deal

33
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,389
I so got a text box remote

34
00:01:57,389 --> 00:02:02,490
its wired to a laptop the patrol that
x-box remote Sens command center

35
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,799
better encoded into specialized bike
man's I wrote

36
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,330
there said across the wire Wireless XP
connection which I get into

37
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,720
that then connects to the onboard
controller here

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,810
and the blimp which is actually a former
computer running Ubuntu 10 4

39
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,030
that in turn sends commands to the rotor
so

40
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,020
with any basic aircraft I know they're
just had a previous talk about

41
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,350
helicopters but your basic controls our
pitch

42
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,630
roll and yaw so pitch of course controls
the nose of the aircraft

43
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,970
role as good beer side to side and then
ya is going to be here

44
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,820
your compass asthma here so if we have a
blimp then

45
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,560
we have the same controls and we just
manipulate Petroni are different manners

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,530
so for pitch we essentially manipulate
the tail

47
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,170
up till elevator on to to

48
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,390
apply force as a result to the win the
can also manipulate the prospector on

49
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,120
the good ol a

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,420
to patrol the direction the rotors as
far as role goes blimp is

51
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,380
a blimp is naturally I has a very centre

52
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,470
a very heavy center of gravity so it's
going to naturally role

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,410
two-year your normal position so you
really only need to worry about pitch

54
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,050
and yaw

55
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,080
and of course with you are you could
just patrol the tail rotor and then you

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,100
can go left to right

57
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,250
cell the idea behind the autopilot
algorithm how this goes about working

58
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,100
is I don't care about pitch and yaw so I
have I need to establish a target pitch

59
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,590
in a target ya so the target pitch is
established based on your current

60
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,410
altitude

61
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,760
and you target out to turn that tells
you whether you wanna pitch upper down

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,840
and for ya you have your current as myth

63
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,300
and then you have your target as myth
which is based on GPS coordinates

64
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,720
so with both of those things you can
easily determine 22 go up or down

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,080
do need to turn left to right so from
there you have the intensity of how hard

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,880
you wanna Turner how hard you want to
pitch

67
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,090
and that's based on the differential
between those two so it's directly

68
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,910
proportional

69
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,490
to the relative did relative distance
between those two things

70
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,510
are

71
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,480
so here's the overall starts offer
architects behind what we have

72
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,770
so we have a controller which is
responsible for managing all these

73
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,330
different

74
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,810
a synchronous tasks and I just a task
because actually use G event here

75
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,910
so this isn't a talk about G event up
but gee event itself

76
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,970
is emulated threat emulated
multi-threading so it's not actually

77
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,249
multi-threaded

78
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:29,370
you have what's called Green let's hear
it so how this works is essentially

79
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,430
you spawn multiple green let's and as
soon as you create those

80
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,129
their kicked off a synchronously and
what you get at that joint all that's

81
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:38,080
going to block until

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,729
each of those different green lights %uh
finishes its task

83
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,919
so in this case case each one of those
individual green let's with an infinite

84
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,719
loop so didn't have to do that

85
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,710
I we can also do monkey patching

86
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,770
which will take anything that naturally
blocks so in this case we have a serial

87
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,729
connection for example so anytime
anything is blocking

88
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,780
it's going to immediately yield to
another thread so that's also going to

89
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,219
make it

90
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:04,879
when we do timed out sleep Sophie even
at bottom

91
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,249
bottom example we have the sample
greenlit and that's the basic structure

92
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,969
everything agreement we have we're going
to do something

93
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:13,509
we're going to do a little thing and
ever going to sleep which is going to

94
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:14,849
yield to the other threads

95
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:20,110
and once that sleeping is complete it's
going to be reactivated

96
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,999
accel the very first thing we have to do
is we had from to read from sensors

97
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:27,449
so I'll the sessions themselves

98
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,479
had sample code written in C plus plus
naturally the easiest way to interface

99
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:32,229
with them

100
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:35,349
so the basic premise behind what I did

101
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:38,529
as I took the things that I had to write
c plus plus other things that need to be

102
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:39,840
particularly fast

103
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,520
and I bubbled up the high level %uh
extractions to Python

104
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,289
and with Python it's very easy to create
an autopilot algorithm here

105
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,889
cell again this is Anna talk about
bussey there but here's the basic

106
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:55,580
premise we have eighty we have some
things that why do in C plus plus

107
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,409
and we want to create a manager class
for those different things and I we

108
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,759
wanna surface some others functions at
the Python

109
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,139
so here in this example if you look at
the very bottom were surfacing up the

110
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,759
function say hello and getting a jerk
and at the bottom is just how you go

111
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,449
about using that Python

112
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,610
so what this means for us then is that
we can create

113
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,779
these these drivers the rewrite c plus
plus and then here are just

114
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,169
surface this one function at the Python
just get asked that so here

115
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,789
python is gonna call c plus plus code

116
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:27,939
so week that was the example for the
compass

117
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:31,779
so now we can go and do that with every
single one OVR are sensors so in this

118
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:33,319
case I have a GPS

119
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,349
accelerometer compass and an altimeter

120
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:39,469
sell for all others things I have
drivers written in C plus plus I

121
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,349
services function that the Python

122
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:44,770
and I have a sensor manager that manages
all those things

123
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,289
and the controller is then going to poll
the sensor manager every one tenth of a

124
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:50,090
second

125
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,469
and as he gets those values it then
updates communicates with the other

126
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:54,809
green light and tells them

127
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:58,889
about the updates on this case we're
gonna tell the the communicator about it

128
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:01,009
which will send the data back to the
client

129
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:04,680
I with you know what what occurred GPS
is what my outside is

130
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,870
everything else and it's going to
senator the autopilot so the autopilot

131
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,219
relies on the sensor data

132
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:13,539
in order to think and in decide what to
do next

133
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:18,199
so with the camera this is the exact
same concept again

134
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,759
I use Boost and resided here in this
case is because

135
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,550
I relied on a C-plus plus library called
G photo to

136
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,879
it so what that is it's a 8 camera
library

137
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,159
written in C plus plus that supports
hundreds had with cameras

138
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,300
the can then take pictures with them you
can get the Live View I

139
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,520
in my case I had a Canon t2i so what I
want to do

140
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,419
is I want to be able to grab a frame
from the live you and I want to be able

141
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,879
to take a picture remotely

142
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,729
this is all down to the USB or USB
connection

143
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:53,729
I and then a disservice to such the
Python tactic pictures from there

144
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,550
so in order to communicate from the
client to the plan

145
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,009
I use an XP module and with this is it's
basically

146
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:05,499
you can imagine just a a really really
long serial cable that's basically what

147
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:06,599
this is a few

148
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,779
just think about abstraction up its
wireless module

149
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,050
the use the 802 top 15 dot for protocol
which is just a peer to peer

150
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,800
low-power protocol and here you spy
cereal to interface with it

151
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,659
so I can just dynamically find where
where the serial port is loaded

152
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:26,409
or the XP module loaded I can open it
neck and right to in read from it

153
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:30,409
I'm gonna do both those things from the
writer and the reader so in this case

154
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,140
I developed my own sort a communications
protocol which I'm sure a lot of view

155
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,460
back probably imagine that there's
better ways to do this but it worked for

156
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,810
me

157
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,329
but the basic pattern was that I send
ascend

158
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:45,420
a command value and sell the value

159
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,870
what the value means depending on the
command it said before so here it is on

160
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,920
doing I'm sending command in a value

161
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,269
I'm and packing those values in Python

162
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:57,290
into just two bites for short for
instance or

163
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,810
eight by to believe for a float and what
I'm doing as well

164
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,660
is an adding header by had a bite so I
can designate a packet

165
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,690
cell if if there's any sort of packet
loss

166
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,459
I need to be able to reestablish that
stream determine what's the command

167
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:14,829
what's the value so in this case I just
had some reserved by to 254 255

168
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:18,430
and that pattern only appeared in the
header bytes so that we as a bird has it

169
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,839
was a packet

170
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,630
so on the receiving end I have a I have
a reader and writer on both

171
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,870
the controller and the client it so all
this is just doing is just

172
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,990
interpreting that stream and do take the
appropriate action so the basic pattern

173
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,009
is up here

174
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:37,170
I have a dictionary that has the command
and in the appropriate function at Matt

175
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,060
maps Q

176
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,279
and going to call that function as soon
as it gets the command is gonna pass in

177
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,459
the value that we got

178
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,529
so this is just one example in this case
is the

179
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:48,759
the control the use with from the x box
if I press a button its gonna say hey

180
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,980
there's a button pressed

181
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,029
the value is going to be the button that
was pressed and then it's going to take

182
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,720
the appropriate action so

183
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,980
down at the bottom you could see start
issued to kill can't command

184
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,740
up would increase the target out
students so forth

185
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,130
right so to actually control the plant I
made another attraction

186
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,690
where we have a class strictly
responsible for managing the motors

187
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,190
one thing that I did hear that proved to
be very valuable was to make it to the

188
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,199
inputs were basically enumerated data
types

189
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,889
up in this may I could send command just
like pitch up pitch down

190
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:24,100
with an associated value with this
allowed me to do it it allowed me to

191
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,889
independently

192
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:28,120
independently validate the autopilot

193
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,199
and the motor control so essentially I
could do manual control

194
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:34,430
at send commands like pitch up its
down-ballot into the work properly

195
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,459
and with the autopilot I could
essentially validate paid depending on

196
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:39,540
the action I take my outputting

197
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,970
pitch after pitch down here so this has
to

198
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,269
two major functions are exposed to the
controller so we have

199
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,370
tech so every one tenth of a second
going to take an RTI

200
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,500
recalculate what the motors must do next

201
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,949
and then basically update from
instruction so we have other classes

202
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,019
that are updating information here which
is a

203
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:02,360
pretty good pattern to use its tell
don't ask

204
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,389
cell here is the illustration that
pattern here

205
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:09,529
have the autopilot and the manual
control that both subclass

206
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:12,850
a base class and that base pilot has a

207
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,399
think and a get instructions so whether
you're using a patrol the

208
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,620
autopilot you can get the instructions
from them but they're both

209
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,769
updated in their own respective manner
so the autopilot will take input from

210
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,089
but some things from the x box it roll
or the client you can essentially say

211
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:28,670
like

212
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,300
increase the out to decrease the
altitude I send in the GPS cornet

213
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,180
but primarily we're going to use the
sentence centers this case are based on

214
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,100
Saturday to

215
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,579
we're going to respond accordingly and
with many patrol this is based

216
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:44,790
this use purely on the x box which on
this case

217
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,550
which is booked up to the laptop and

218
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,870
custom commander sent across so here's
some sample code in the manual petrol

219
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,649
here

220
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,740
the two public function to mention were
thinkin getting getting

221
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,350
instructions its updated I

222
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,800
it updated its own way so separate them
sick or the horizontal

223
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,509
in this case so as you Senate commands
gonna update what values that suppose to

224
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:11,160
supposed to do and every autopilot it's
basically the same pattern but we're

225
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
just updating fans and as you can see
here

226
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,399
so this is that the sample code for the
ewe there's a lot more that goes into

227
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,209
this but in this case this was

228
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:22,339
I how to calculate yang left her young
right

229
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,769
any social intensity base on the current
asthma

230
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:29,709
and a target at math on so this is kind
of interesting actually because if you

231
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:30,490
imagine

232
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,550
with up pitch this pattern works just
fine because you have

233
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,240
naturally opposing forces so you have
gravity that's going to naturally slow

234
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,149
it down as you pitch up for example

235
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:44,100
with ya there's no counter there's no
opposing forces as you do this so in

236
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,550
this case were actually did

237
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,579
is rather start establish a target
position establish a target velocity

238
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:52,759
so you can imagine getting distant
relatives there and as your

239
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,970
young laughter young bright you
manipulating acceleration to affect

240
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,370
velocity here

241
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,670
I at so as you imagine an we could start
going left as we approach our position

242
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,540
we're gonna realize that we're going too
fast and you can imagine we're Pike

243
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,699
County forces as we get to that point

244
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:14,420
are for the hardware kit on sorry for
the client application here

245
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,569
we're just running a laptop and
appointed a laptop is to be able to set

246
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:18,410
waypoints

247
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,699
so here's have some video that's just
illustrating a point the circle

248
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:22,879
represents the radius

249
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,660
love how far we can communicate with the
blimp so it's a one-mile radius services

250
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,990
two miles across

251
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,310
and two miles high and you can click any
point within that range and he's XP

252
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,220
modules are supposed to be one mile

253
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,449
minus site collectivity are and then so
from here

254
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:40,459
I also use the Google Maps API and never
turned a PNG

255
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,779
nice open CV go ahead brendor that PNG
onto a jury

256
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:47,639
I wrote some other stuff on there and
took mouse input and things like that

257
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,089
with the x box it roll I can use Boost
and here you cannot

258
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:55,720
other c plus plus library which is STL
and a gadget surface those highlevel

259
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,160
high-level I am things to be carried out
to Python

260
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,750
which tend to care for everything else
so

261
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,579
al bomber and pick up the sound so
here's the the actual min flight so I

262
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,439
did is

263
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,670
I had this theory that if I could take
make the center's work in concert

264
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,600
manipulate the servos and everything

265
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
then we could go ahead and

266
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,079
it make a test platform and change the
autopilot algorithm

267
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,100
but as you saw action work because that
had a big center of gravity prom at that

268
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,050
point I decided to just go ahead

269
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,720
and shipped to the blame so

270
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,420
now for a hardware at the preamp some
questions I'm sure like you might have

271
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,459
white and I use a Raspberry Pi

272
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,769
the honest answer is that when I was
putting this together I didn't really

273
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,300
know enough about it and just

274
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,529
after some googling I found the single
board computer iro Board RRB 110 which

275
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:46,410
is x1 hardware but it wasn't very well
documented

276
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,120
but a few advantages had a had over the
Raspberry Pi to begin with

277
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,319
this variable voltage is I think it
supports anywhere from six to 24 volts

278
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:57,860
input I and you can connect service
directly

279
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,939
get a guy to see directly and then
here's a summer the

280
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:04,050
you can see some the other sensors that
are you charlie talked about but we had

281
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,399
XRM the accelerometer compass I we had

282
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,560
which we use the accelerometer to find
out what petronella was

283
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,069
the altimeter was a a temperature
pressure and humidity sensor

284
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:20,990
the cat then calculate a relative
altitude are based on a0 wised

285
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,939
the rise out to the city started the the
application

286
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:29,490
aren't cell the

287
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,089
most difficult part of this project was
independently balloting everything

288
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,660
so with a blimp especially we have them
it's very large

289
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,410
very costly to inflate it so this is
about a hundred dollars where the helium

290
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,959
I so if we could Valatie everything
independently and then bring them

291
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,870
together that was a much better

292
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,279
option better thing to do so on the top
left that's an example up automated

293
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,930
pitch control so you can see it as a
manipulating

294
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,490
the gondola its the sensors are
responding appropriately and

295
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,720
telling the servos to manipulate the
prospector and the center images just

296
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,449
me actually doing ap full-blown plant to
address the videos

297
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:08,449
top right I'm going left and right I am

298
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:12,240
bottom left I am manipulating servo to
change the prospector

299
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,899
and the bottom right I am just changing
the motor controlled actually speed

300
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:20,499
upper speed down

301
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:24,170
cell I this demo is pretty wild

302
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,660
I works a lot was I can actually build
any the hardware here

303
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,999
I didn't build the plant I just did the
softer portion of it

304
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:34,620
and I was working with the guy in San
Diego from a company called eap lamp

305
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,069
and I went down with him and work on
this project together

306
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:41,430
and of course testing the right here we
actually filmed wasn't the best of

307
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,350
conditions

308
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,540
I got down there and this'll small park
in the guy told me like all right you

309
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,100
got power lines here to get a free way
they're so

310
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,160
good luck I so that was a little
frightening because

311
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,170
when we we have this blimp which

312
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,449
if the motors are on is going to fly
away and its optimized for a prolonged

313
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:04,459
airtime so this is quite scary because
if there were some sort of exception

314
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:05,620
that I didn't account for

315
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,470
the motors were just keep spinning and
we just go off into the distance L

316
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,350
actually bit did add some a safety
mechanisms in there which

317
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,529
actually pretty be very vital so for
example if it doesn't receive

318
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:19,959
communication for five seconds I'll go
ahead and pitch down

319
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:22,970
and I kill the motor so that actually
proved to be invaluable because

320
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,650
the very first time I did manual testing
if the other guy that flew it and a

321
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,750
I did in fact make a mistake long story
short and he flew it up

322
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,669
and then Kalol excited and ripped the
x-box patrol outlets or just flew away

323
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:40,190
so five seconds later came back down now
onto a roof

324
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,640
hey go get that but dori was good

325
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,279
so the pump itself is not actually
lighter than air it's about 95 percent

326
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,270
plan so as you can see right here

327
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,529
it does just rests on something on but
creating left is very easy

328
00:17:53,529 --> 00:18:00,529
and as you moving forward the blimp
itself axed like a wing

329
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,890
so are some of the biggest pitfalls that
I had so

330
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,029
ironically the most challenging part in
this project

331
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:12,230
was getting when X installed under the
single board computer so

332
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,370
there's limited ran to begin with so you
can just install from ac/dc soon if it

333
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,539
is dismayed by tram

334
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:21,220
I and you also have to install a custom
kernel because

335
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,710
there's a specialized chipset here so

336
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,350
would if you do you want to use this
hardware I do have resources that I put

337
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,370
on my blog so

338
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:34,419
actually have a working Ubuntu 10 for
image that you just copy onto an SD card

339
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:38,799
and get this working immediately another
problem I had was the initial setup a

340
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,029
boost

341
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:44,770
I for any Python programmers are really
recommend that you just do a hello world

342
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,210
program with boost because as you do
that it's really going to open some

343
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,860
doors to some libraries the UN otherwise
be able to use

344
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,159
so if you know in your back pocket you
can use in DC plus plus library that you

345
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,210
want

346
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,620
it's very useful to know how to use
Boost and if you get that make file

347
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,460
working once

348
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,570
and in my case I ran into some issues
because the

349
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,760
version a python on my path was
different from the papon headers that I

350
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,820
to piled against

351
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,169
and took me a long time to figure out
that

352
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:16,029
that problem was going on so another
challenge here

353
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,279
was that the the communication mechanism
I

354
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,510
and using as a mention is next module to
that a serial connection so

355
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,029
you're sending commands linearly and
interpreting them linearly

356
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:31,640
so not only is is that somewhat slow I

357
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,740
but yeah there's also not much
throughput cell

358
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,210
the autopilot itself actually flew way
better than I can

359
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,100
because it the I mean the response time
for me human is much lower than just on

360
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,159
your calculations in recalculations

361
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:47,220
an act creating a response so

362
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,270
another big problem was properly reading
the altimeter so

363
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,590
as I mention the ultimate I have was a
pressure temperature and humidity sensor

364
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,760
and so the problem there is that Augusta
when will that affect both the pressure

365
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,770
and the temperature

366
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,950
and the result is that the out touring
change so

367
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,130
essentially because the wind is gonna it
comes that's the plan

368
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,480
it's going to thank on at a different
house 222 pitch so

369
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,520
Augusta when would cause a thing to
basically pitcher random which would

370
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,419
then push the plank

371
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:17,950
plant back cell I wanna had switched to
GPS

372
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,490
and apparently you have the same problem
so the GPS still gives fluctuating

373
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,880
readings for altitude

374
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,169
which then causes them to pitch happened
at random so I

375
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,210
I guess with with GPS satellites its
easy to triangulate the action live

376
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,799
because satellites are spread apart but
I guess the z-axis a lot is a little

377
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,659
more challenging because you can't do
that same kinda triangulation

378
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:41,799
ass I learned about that so i havent
entirely solve that problem

379
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,620
up and then be on that in just a matter
of accounting for the wind

380
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,350
because any problem that you have like
the the pitching prominent mention

381
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,490
or the yelling problem I mention
nationally where it would cost like

382
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,419
I started out by using position so idk
awesomely overshoot the on because in

383
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:00,830
the absence of any sort counteracting
force

384
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,570
so when you bring the wind into the
picture that's going to exacerbate

385
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,700
any flaws that you actually have so

386
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,179
those were some the biggest pitfalls

387
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:16,080
mom art so i'd I do need to go ahead and
give some credit where credit is due

388
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,870
here

389
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,960
so as I said I worked a guy named Larry
Fleming from the plant dot com

390
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,570
is a hardware guy so was really the
jury's to have his party this

391
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,450
I Roger who is one of my coworkers and
he was

392
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,730
amazing athletics was the only reason I
was ever get it installed on the board

393
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,340
and I also got a little help from a guy
from Eric am

394
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,789
dot com

395
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:42,049
so I if you want to get any of these
resources

396
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:45,260
I have all of the parts list so
everything I use

397
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,429
I've sample code in Python for every
single module I

398
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:54,500
and I have I have like the the laser cut
design for the acrylic peace to you some

399
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,380
out the board in all the screws and
everything associated with that

400
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,730
the working robe or damaged it running
Ubuntu 10 for to a contact me

401
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,450
others my email and once again we have
the plant after party

402
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,850
across the street at the west end so you
can come find us there

403
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,220
so at that actually brings to a close

404
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:21,220
I can take any questions

405
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:31,770
if you would

406
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,390
moving this to look inside area where
you can have GPS

407
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,130
kinda about how you could get like a 3d
representations

408
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,530
location internal space so there are
certain to solve that problem

409
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,590
and I don't know much about them but I
do know that they're very expensive so

410
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,490
you have something that like basic
represented UPSC

411
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,640
at I really can't answer that with
confidence but you have some for the

412
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,770
amount I ceiling

413
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,730
and you can try angulated position I but

414
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,290
yeah I mean that that's that's not a
problem you can only use the GPS

415
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,070
outdoors

416
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,250
even then it takes a while to get a fix
thank you good to me

417
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,380
thank you couldn't talk my name is on a
bond

418
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,860
bismarck I don't absolutely excellent
here

419
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,990
media at thank you yeah

420
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,160
the only question I have is but I didn't
repeat helium

421
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,720
want to keep money cheap hydrogel
matches have a fellow who's this

422
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,140
II so ash well I the answers that I did
up but I thought people might not like

423
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,900
it if I had this hydrogen filled

424
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,640
plant in here and of course up my
company as gracious lease

425
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,900
the %ah spots on my efforts at this
point and they are actually paying for

426
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,049
the healing never just me I would use
hydrogen

427
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:42,700
I and I actually did take the time to
manufacture my own hydrogen using

428
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,590
electrolysis

429
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:48,770
planet that was not very easy it also
the math is basically that one and power

430
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,040
will generate point for one leaders of
hydrogen

431
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,679
so that's the first problem is that not
very efficient and then be on that

432
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:56,280
actually get that amperage

433
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,720
with electro house is very difficult to
actually made this little contraption

434
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,210
with carbon graphite electrodes I put
potassium hydroxide in the water

435
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,720
that the graphite made it so the metal
was in part a reaction and

436
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,500
but then the the resistant to the water
was still very very high even with a

437
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,760
really large power supply

438
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,650
so I can only generate a small amount
hydrogen and what you got to that point

439
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,809
I you had a gas that wasn't pressurized

440
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,970
so is very difficult to manipulate so
that point it at hydrogen

441
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:28,020
blew it up and I burned my finger and
that's where do with that

442
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,190
what's up her

443
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,320
your up so

444
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,890
following offer what you said a little
bit do you have any tips on how to

445
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,970
convince your company to purchase
wannabes

446
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,830
I I don't know I'm

447
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,860
know will hit I get so the story behind
us

448
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,309
I actually started this project before I
joined my company I

449
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:55,700
so my initial goal was to do aerial
photography sybase I wanted to build a

450
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,990
django application

451
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,160
that has a buncha pictures an automated
when the way

452
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,210
like building a counter view based on
when the pictures taken extracted from

453
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,040
the exit data

454
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,110
now wanna just go to public places and
take pictures and had a domain name on

455
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,610
the plan but others and whatever

456
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,610
but I stopped working what I got my
company cuz I had to do real work

457
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,650
at so if you if you get up I can talk or
something

458
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,650
claiming to have a plan then I hope you
so that that I thought

459
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,410
yeah similar questions first

460
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,470
one which is yeah I I guess do you know
if the

461
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,580
on South Tower locations like

462
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,940
contains its hi and if it does strangely

463
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,730
so so you're saying basic get a better
GPS signal

464
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,020
by using do the same thing itself wants
to triangulate your height data with

465
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,919
cellular

466
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,900
you trying yellow certainly be a better
way to do it

467
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,679
the done with the cost have time in
getting this done so.

468
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,159
on yeah I would certainly be a better
solution but I'd

469
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,460
did not do it short yeah I was wondering
if you

470
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,340
found a solution to the from the wind
and the pressure changing

471
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,540
same it's just capping like how fast you
with expected to change in

472
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,419
waiting for two so their I mean infused
different things to do with that I have

473
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:14,020
exactly

474
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,480
figured out what to try next I the point
is I haven't really been into the test

475
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,770
that you never leave actually doing a

476
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,890
lot preparations coming here are but a
few ideas I had were too

477
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,950
for instance take the average altitude
reading

478
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,950
over the past second and then use that
another example would be to go ahead and

479
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,620
assume that I can maintain

480
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,559
an altitude like so once I reach it then
stop stopped reading for a little bit

481
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,380
until I change the target outfit again

482
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,720
on to the a few ideas that I like to
play with I just haven't got a chance

483
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,990
actually test it yet

484
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,490
thank miles talk

485
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,590
I do you have any experience with any
other like

486
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,730
drone platforms like a zombie

487
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,929
33 robotics are about two sons are they
like a did you choose to go with

488
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:02,020
ago you know for Linux computer incident

489
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,100
using that for specific reason yeah I
guess I'm departed

490
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,200
I I don't know enough about it like

491
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,000
I know I mean this the short answers
that no I didn't do that and we look

492
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,030
into it much

493
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,730
I I kinda felt confident his writing my
own but presence I know like

494
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,070
typically with these auto pilot projects
he would use an art we now are but I

495
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,110
know I can I I don't know much about it
but I know there are limitations with

496
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,130
them so I know like are tweeners for
instance don't have a lot of RAM

497
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,250
so you actually acted be Koch said that
wire coating

498
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,409
I where's here with my system I really
don't have to worry about that because

499
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:35,350
I'm actually just running a full-blown

500
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,940
version of Ubuntu awesome picnics

501
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,230
and fish that is basically and kinda
said

502
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,550
driving hey what's that and cassette is
driving

503
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,580
if oh yeah I wanna put a saddle on top
in STL right around but

504
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,770
it all has eight-pound paleo in SAS cell

505
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,409
little too heavy whereas ness is a hot
missing would you be there

506
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:02,880
trying to make something like this
run-up

507
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,700
I yeah so that actually was a fairly
common question was a people that I was

508
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,399
working with I like honestly I don't
know enough about how to

509
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,230
how to communicate between the phone the
controller or I don't know how to

510
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,700
like what the best way to go about doing
that and this case I just got these XP

511
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,419
modules which

512
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,580
I think total cost like $70 dollars so

513
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,860
that was just the choice I went with
nice if

514
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,890
yeah it

515
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,610
the great up couple questions

516
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,510
what was the total cost how long
actually taking

517
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,730
its okay yes that's a good question the
cost

518
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,059
its okay so the cost I love

519
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:48,010
building it was much so okay so the
plant itself is

520
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,110
several thousand dollars in get these
from I get from a black dot com

521
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,899
basically

522
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,760
depending on the size it's going to
affect how much it is but the magnitude

523
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,300
is several thousand dollars

524
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,730
the hardware that I bought all cost less
than a thousand

525
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,390
which is actually much cheaper than if
you were to go would like an analogue

526
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,100
solutions so like I know there are some
systems to like

527
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,540
record video aerial video or whatever
with purely analog systems I think

528
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,190
there's a power drop problems as well

529
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,570
the draw more power but short answer
yeah but less than a thousand dollars

530
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,950
the helium itself a in total about to
enter fifty dollars for

531
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,320
three cubic feet which fill this up
twice

532
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,350
yeah oo sorry

533
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,679
I started this project over year ago put
on hold for a while

534
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,480
and then for the past few months have
been spending I mean

535
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,640
a bit I short probably about three
months total like seriously working on

536
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,390
it

537
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:47,390
okay i guess im at a time the thank you
very much

538
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,340
thank you
