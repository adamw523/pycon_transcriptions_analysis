1
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,150
week

2
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:22,150
ok

3
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,420
up

4
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,680
hard

5
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,680
want

6
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:15,810
up

7
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:27,130
now

8
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,200
alright

9
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,900
it's about time to get started and the
first talk in this session is by

10
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,980
down minor is going to give is a scenic
drive through the Django

11
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,980
request cycle demand

12
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,790
thank you now see partial as I me my
name is Dan miner

13
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,900
me developer manager waving trial or
small or start-up

14
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,020
help small businesses be successful but
they're all my tools

15
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,980
and I'm gonna talk with generous request
spots like

16
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,840
that's why spend the majority my time
majengo now

17
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,880
opinion Django for a bow clover two
years

18
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,810
injector does have a lot of part thought
might come to except

19
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,360
enjoy deal with out but when you're
starting out

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,120
it's not all obvious how the oft usually
go on working with some guys on my team

21
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,400
were experienced as health dept just
coming to Django

22
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,730
they went was struggling with notions
like I have this very behind we get into

23
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,380
a template

24
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,560
which pair talked to me but apparently
if you're coming from

25
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,610
back doesn't have so many different
layers part something to talk about in a

26
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,230
particular

27
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,950
her request turned into response which i
think is why the most fundamental

28
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,770
not the most fundamental operations
check now

29
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,610
speaking abolished parts might have
given way the ending this is

30
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,610
somewhat how it all works that's great
offers awkward

31
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,080
but you can see there's a lot going on
here's a number of words repeated

32
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,650
there's

33
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,200
you shaking going on middleware in a
bunch places

34
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,130
soft talk about what this actually
indifferent to do that

35
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,000
which door with her quest it all begins
so in a long

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,410
a long long time ago a consul far-right
out

37
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,600
ultra someone type this shoes

38
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,640
said I wanna curl -o to Daniel Agger dot
com slash hello slashing to:

39
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,850
and the press Enter and then the cops
back

40
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,220
and this is crossing what actually and
that's what it's doing

41
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,620
sending her a HD 1.1 GetRequest

42
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,340
to slash hello slash Intel saying I want
a response from the host

43
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,950
Dec home and I mean except just anything
comes back

44
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,020
and from there one across the and I'm
not gonna talk but have how it works

45
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,660
that talking up itself but trust me when
that person

46
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,770
me in this case pressed enter they
requested or across the internet and

47
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,430
ended up

48
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,880
Tampa looks like this it more gonna call
webster

49
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,820
now in practice this web servers
probably engine actor

50
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,870
actually by that shit is popular
nowadays bottom line is it's a web

51
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,340
server

52
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,729
and the web server fundamentally takes
her quest

53
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,180
and gives back response and how it does
that

54
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,330
changes on what color us for talk static

55
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,919
quest something simple file it's just on
a machine the web server probably just

56
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:17,750
handle itself

57
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,710
through a response back itself but if
it's more complex

58
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,750
setting something that's powered by web
application like

59
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,110
check let's say get for more cock as it
we have to ask the question well

60
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,450
how does the web server itself which may
be written in C

61
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,600
or something how does I communicate with

62
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,300
I thought process the track and thus a
change in the past

63
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,650
so back in the day the early 2000's

64
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,820
there wasn't simple way to do it
different web servers did

65
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,620
ways different from work today different
ways some web server support my python

66
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,200
sometime

67
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,340
expert passage I and it meant that your
search your choice

68
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,610
web server and web framework was happy
couple together which

69
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,830
motivation has top web surfer people to
steal from our people

70
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,050
stuff from our people said care for web
surfers and nobody like

71
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,560
so what we ended up with was kept 333
called whiskey

72
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,010
web server key face its answer the
question how to Python frameworks and

73
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,690
web services

74
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,320
tracked common and simple way by web

75
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,789
applications on top check the Big Valley

76
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,320
whiskey in petrie came out was

77
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,380
simplicity in these damn as the guys
wrote it knew

78
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,200
if it was in Tampa life it wasn't easy
to switch no actually do anything

79
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,390
left so they want and they made it
simple and they made

80
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,620
one reelection point between whiskey
wearing a web server

81
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,130
want to rest are any web application in
this is about

82
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,210
your mental possible kitchen you can see
the whiskey protocol

83
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,680
which is call something called function

84
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,880
call it takes two arguments I'm which
have particular format

85
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,330
the standard talks about does some stuff
to it and then

86
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,780
returns and terrible strings I wish

87
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,800
is careful not to talk how'd to ration
just s5 given this

88
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,990
he can run in a particular way will get
back some handles

89
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,400
spot the other thing to highlight their
is that there's nothing stable and

90
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,220
every request has its own amber on
Sunstar response

91
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,580
there's nothing in their last by
definition whiskey

92
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,690
track response to another so any type
assistant

93
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,870
session management has happened web
application now

94
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,310
probably thinking if I said the whiskey
is the way that web service QQ

95
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,030
applications and Django is web
application runs

96
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,000
doesn't speak with you the answer yes so
in general and

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,370
your whiskey up whiskey where is in
Django decor

98
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,040
hammers scammers and with a couple
things

99
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,260
hold off for simplicity look something
like this:

100
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,430
if you look at the shape compared to
last light

101
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,340
very similar and that they're both calls

102
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,500
they both take two arguments and Bronze
Star sponse

103
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,100
which are customarily called up not find
sir

104
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,570
and they both returned something in this
case something

105
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,919
itself kept you can see what's up doc a
response is really the biggest thing

106
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,150
of doctors months after two interesting
things about it

107
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,449
gonna spend a lot of time going have
function works first interesting thing

108
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,639
is that's not to find on whiskey soft

109
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,500
based on which I thought was weird my
first looking into this

110
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,829
but it turns out there's one other class
Jack

111
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:40,370
hospital December only one what that is

112
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,500
is that thing around the jacket has so
that when you're ready

113
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,630
generation when you're fired task hi

114
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,650
as much as possible the exact same
copout

115
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,740
as you get your whiskey you go into your
normal I

116
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,709
you to skip the other interesting thing

117
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:01,040
about how this structured is itself
doctor response tix request

118
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,060
which you'll see is not part West 9
bronner start

119
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,370
request object to something that's great
and that first ellipses

120
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,720
here it's a Jager structure that
encompasses their question everything

121
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,220
that

122
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,290
understand quest this where check your

123
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,270
Stockport whiskey hammers it's the last
place in check we actually see deal with

124
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,120
whiskey

125
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,699
arrest check below it doesn't care what
have we got there just cares but what it

126
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,380
needs in order to run

127
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,800
so jump into court base hammers

128
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,949
this is really what happens in tears of
base hammer itself is how to rock a

129
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,650
response is that mean

130
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,449
about lipitor roster spot cycle to
understand how our questions into

131
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:40,290
response

132
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,650
through understanding how this works
these are the sort

133
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,699
basic steps but before we get into that
for the catalyst we see the wooden mill

134
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:48,930
workers there

135
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,300
fact on the six lines that are in there

136
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,440
for middleware is involved for them so
let's take

137
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,470
a progression to what I mean when I say
middleware before we see things

138
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,420
if you're coming from a more enterprise
background when her middleware

139
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,949
you likely think something big something
heavy something like or future J

140
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:08,370
daughter in common

141
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,660
something the bosses bosses boss of
seven million dollars

142
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,890
his department to run its rally paint

143
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,610
which article for the exact opposite
jacko

144
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,030
with talks to Skype Django middleware is
too late low-level plugin system for

145
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,070
globally altering

146
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,329
changed the two interesting points there

147
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:30,850
a globally all-time liked late

148
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,780
you'll see as we get into looking at the
structure have expected side have

149
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,900
installed

150
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,050
and globally is a really unique thing
but jail a middleware

151
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,870
a place the jack week a system is that
they're on every request that comes in

152
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,310
ever goto whereas everything else

153
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,449
gets far behind a viewer tasks

154
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:52,820
has an example what late means is
installing a middleware is really just

155
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,750
adding a line to accept file you'll find
when you

156
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,070
or proper settings file it comes in the
project template you've got a middleware

157
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,520
classes dictionary

158
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,089
add something to it it'll get picked up
when you look at first time you'll see

159
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,270
some things there

160
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,020
should probably been they're pretty
useful by should also add

161
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,530
grocer so with that in mind with

162
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,850
I thought on when middleware means
Django context

163
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,089
let's look at the first step which is
your quest or

164
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,679
across middleware what it's for is it
handles

165
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,980
things that happened on all in power I
say requests and not few calls

166
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,270
at the time with your her quest power we
don't know how

167
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,290
handle all we know is this: requests
come in to the whiskey where

168
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,809
down here have a look at the structure

169
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:42,819
will see some therapy a few times in the
other opinion what I said one little

170
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,800
Millers are simple system

171
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,809
of middleware is I know jack project as
a method

172
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:53,410
processors quest which takes her quest
the pact

173
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,860
an account early return only one of two
things

174
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,420
he can return you there HTTP response
which is a full-on

175
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,640
check response object and if it does
that the rest the pipeline stops

176
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,760
goes there missus this usually happens
if you've done your

177
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,850
medication in a general question aware
which is a good place to do it

178
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,949
if you use account is not authenticated
mill where would you shut down the

179
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:15,800
process

180
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,050
retract that you to a login page without
having to go through any thereafter

181
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,829
where's system or her turn

182
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:26,550
not as Miller's waves I have no to

183
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,579
I've done my business what happened this
keep on going to

184
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,100
stack so this middleware

185
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,520
tickle you can see just takes a request
which means it doesn't know the few

186
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,230
that's good

187
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,520
this missus to look stage if

188
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,569
what you are doing this request does
require knowing what you will handle it

189
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:48,160
configured 0 really just check as a
later step in the process

190
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,510
captured so

191
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:57,290
before he gonna take small break catch
up on where we are

192
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,780
we've gone and we start with her quest
came from

193
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,540
hi did something press curl already when
used with breast click

194
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,520
that request when I across the internet
guide land on a web server

195
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,780
the web server took her quest our state
using

196
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,459
gone through whiskey where went out I
times Django

197
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,679
in Django for stepdaughter cost or

198
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,390
so at this point we have request object
have some stuff done to it

199
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,300
have really done anything else which is
what's coming next

200
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,990
in the next thing up analyst is
resolving that URL

201
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,089
interview Oct is often URL

202
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,270
is the process by definition taking URL

203
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,720
like day like dot com slash hella
slashing TL

204
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,270
and mapping that to a few function it's
gonna

205
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,900
if you're new web framework sir come
from back static site

206
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,260
you look at your like I Daniel Agger
accomplish slashing to:

207
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,579
and you would think that somewhere in
the end below the Weber was director

208
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,490
called a low

209
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,579
below that to director called MTL book
that

210
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:04,589
when the next which would show whatever
you get a response to this

211
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:08,059
and that is how work but that's not
necessarily back officer

212
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:12,339
how doesn't work and Jack at this point
using

213
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,709
your %ah resolution all we really do

214
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:18,790
help slash hello slash MTL is just a map

215
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,959
shows we can specify using a former look
something like this:

216
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,780
what flash hellaflush until does way
relates to interview hartley gets used

217
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,380
we can in this case I've got a small how
to block bomb

218
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,780
what's called a URL of and shows two
different ways you can make them

219
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,230
the first one is supports just saying
but map slash hella slashing to:

220
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,339
hi Intel just a director mapping

221
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,299
in a sec 10 is a little more complex
issues a regular expression

222
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:51,610
and it saying I wanna map slash hello
flash

223
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,290
anything else in America High City so a
commuter

224
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,230
past like slash hello slash Toronto you
would end up there

225
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,939
now the important thing is that these go
in order

226
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:07,750
and we resolved URL matches first wins

227
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,689
so if we switch to europe think look
like this this is what used to be

228
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:15,040
now just switch the order in this case

229
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,309
slash hellaflush Intel would go to high
City comes in it as well

230
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:23,390
what is hello slash anything after
shallow slash India match is this a lot

231
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,030
still go deal with high City

232
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,309
enough to actually get hyped

233
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:34,220
now when we look at those patterns I
mention the first section which is

234
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,809
for the Mac damage in the second section
which is the view to get

235
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:40,910
by but the third section the name High
City

236
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,040
some or and it's a way that we can refer
programmatically what

237
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,040
this URL looks like what it does

238
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,500
front URL anywhere but using using

239
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,890
those two functions bottom of the screen
the world template tag

240
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,610
first function just for firms them that
way means that we decouple the

241
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,510
relationships between pages

242
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,620
the world selves which is an interesting
idea something you can't

243
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,360
status of we decouple the relationship
between two pages

244
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,410
and the way to generate a link between
actual content

245
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,970
self so all we do is we call reverse
High City

246
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,530
injectable give me what right now based
on how my world except right now

247
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,650
you rush doing that

248
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,439
means we can do something like this we
can go and change the URL structure

249
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:26,520
totally

250
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,150
we've gone change hello hi said

251
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,730
K hi surge I'll and now everything just
works

252
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,270
hasn't gone everywhere way you to
dynamic lookup

253
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,000
is at high tech to figure X URL

254
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,199
thinkstock this is an art thing but

255
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,170
trust or fine diversions on a couple
times thank you soft

256
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,640
so without a away and seeing how those

257
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,510
can have a backup OK Corral Africa and
see that slash Alice lashing tail

258
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,290
well goes and matches too high till we
figure that out

259
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,490
we're done with mister

260
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,350
now next long list we've got a few
Miller's

261
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,579
human workers almost exactly the same
thing quest

262
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,230
where agreed on our going to a except

263
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,439
at this point we now know the view
object

264
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,699
so where's your question aware just took
a request object humidor text her quest

265
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:27,880
and if you object in all honesty

266
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,190
I don't I never actually build one
myself

267
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,590
in searching through the Jager docs
examples I found one get one good case

268
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,240
for them

269
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,510
which is the way the jackal Django
handle CSR but it's there

270
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,190
if you find yourself in that situation
one your middle word to know something

271
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,520
about the view itself

272
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,540
you middleware is the place you do it

273
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,280
but the real point and the real meet
their quest response like

274
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,250
and we'll do all your work is the view

275
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,640
views are where botch work your side

276
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,230
rendering system where you going to cost
databases

277
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,330
but says when we talk with your
resolution

278
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,140
we said that's harsh hella class
champion mapped it high till you

279
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,120
and this is about the simplest possible
view that we could dude

280
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,780
no magic on here just function takes
request object

281
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,110
and returns top in this case the
something she took your spot

282
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,190
which you just give it a string and will
send back

283
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,630
heading love you back Stasko that's hot
the only thing

284
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,110
jagger could respond with some other
ones which you may find useful and

285
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:38,910
my you got your shit response.redirect
which is afoot Rasen back its

286
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,490
reject somewhere else there's a
difference apostle you wanna 301 or 302

287
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,720
as Jason response which is just coming
up 1.7

288
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,130
which is designed for if you're dealing
with Chase on it just takes a dictionary

289
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,900
will serialize things are properly
summary hatter's its

290
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:01,900
is nothing you can do now but we'll see
a couple lines process

291
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,520
and there's a skirmish response which is
are much different

292
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,280
marked whereas all our other response
types

293
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,690
couldn't ones I have mention take a full

294
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,260
string body thanks deal with streaming
it should check your response text later

295
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,299
instance on for sponsoring haven't yet
figured out what your

296
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:24,260
send you can enter also that want to get
back up to the top

297
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,260
whiskey where that's way to keep calm
here monitor

298
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,650
now on one hand this is cool because it
means you can have a very large

299
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,110
longer response an hour memory

300
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,270
had also as you have a long and response
an hour

301
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,390
so with cherished response it's there
it's an uphill battle for you

302
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,720
it will break a few other middleware as
per most those handle it well

303
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,870
but think about what you doing when you
choose to use it is

304
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,130
future cases for but a lot of criticism
when you think you want to use this

305
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,880
where you should really be doing is
looking what're actually try deliverance

306
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,780
well

307
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,180
is this better suited to put the
long-running task tears

308
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,040
this better suited to run of lining up
push notification

309
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,590
but if it's not you've got the auction
but for now

310
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,120
mystic aged spot because at some point
gets the point

311
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,590
now have called this a function a few
times cuz it is just function

312
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,230
but that's not the only way right your
other option

313
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,340
something that looks like this and it's
called a class-based few

314
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,460
because it's a few based cost like

315
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,800
the defining features that a subclass
checkered accused of genera

316
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,810
dot view and as a function they're
called get

317
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,390
as one compost times the per child work

318
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,810
to use function base used to use hospice
used

319
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,840
if there's 10 people under got fifteen
different answers

320
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,440
there is no one right one depends where
you're at track you

321
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,520
I like hospice use but I'm gonna stick
with transfer s this

322
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,550
there some particular so

323
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,820
at the I mentioned in those last use

324
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,030
that how with the views there are
actually

325
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,280
their simplest form but they're not
funny as they were going mixing

326
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,560
HTML i thought id share same function
blocks which

327
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,360
by your lodge do that you're gonna have
a bad time Chester scale up to start

328
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,580
work designers

329
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,210
what you try to do anything shall be on
basic stricter pollution

330
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,210
so what we've done here is set up using
a template

331
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,520
and so on dollar does you can't see
what's on high until

332
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,650
now it just sets a picture contact in
this case

333
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,960
addiction with key city in the answer
Montreal

334
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,310
and then passes that context down into a
function called render

335
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,020
which would give in template as well
using check templating language

336
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,270
and echoes the render function will take
that template function substitute city

337
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,100
in Montreal in to replace

338
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,340
action up in Tunisia response object
term

339
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,890
so did this works and this is a nice
simple way to do it

340
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,320
I am a lot so I wanna get a faster and
now I i the second thing to my check

341
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,650
template I've said I also want to say
hello to city from

342
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,630
your request I wanna do that on every
page on my site

343
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,800
so i cud both reach my views ID in that
second minor

344
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,190
by city people's goip dot something or
some other vendor

345
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,660
or after what's your quest back at night

346
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,400
about that Cinco de ver my side and I
have to worry about it

347
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,870
means that I've got also its repetition
or don't need it

348
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,960
but I really like something in the same
with a middleware works on all requests

349
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,600
I'd like something that works I'll
render of which does best

350
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,810
that's called come pick up it a contacts
processor

351
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,810
so temper Costco complex processes very
simple

352
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,580
they really just look like function the
tix request object returned Dec

353
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,090
but the interesting thing why they're
useful is that they're on

354
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,230
all across are on all grander of

355
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,280
once about it topic co-processor sorry
public context processor

356
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,720
list except so if we've gone mad

357
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,560
that we can go back are a few and
template will just look like this

358
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,230
in the view itself all we have to worry
about setting the city

359
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,490
because we know that in the context
processor

360
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,980
later in the pipeline it will handle for
know what your question

361
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,750
question now at this point

362
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,190
wanted one last pass before keep going
go back up

363
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,220
talk with howard got afford that please
look at

364
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,700
that picture this place is called short
is it

365
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,610
20 minutes away to first time to
Montreal in been here before

366
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,920
please go here I will be a cultural
experience for you offered

367
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,120
sandwich order a large plate medium shot

368
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:52,120
pic of life fries black cherry gonna be
tired afterwards but you'll appreciate

369
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,120
so with with that where I hope you all
will go for lunch

370
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,270
I'll let's step back and look at how we
got where we are

371
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,550
and we started with the choir we went
across the higher again to

372
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,330
the Internet to the web server which
communicate with genuine Python

373
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,110
3 whiskey where with an quest where

374
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,220
way URL resolution

375
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,120
dealt with the view middleware and then
dealt with the view itself view itself

376
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,510
django template template in and then
Welsh

377
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,380
the contact process a complete couple
and at this point

378
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,690
when our last ep and bass family which
is there a spot

379
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,880
on the way in at the beginning a
middleware a similar was interesting

380
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,200
and just filler in particular
interesting because it had

381
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,980
takes action both on the way in and on
the way

382
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:48,080
by in an hour how some insert down now
state picture

383
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,270
on the way an use your question or
middleware reason I would have no way

384
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:52,690
writing

385
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,420
mention never used before but on the way
back spot

386
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,180
and if you look at the structure it
looks suspicious and later quest where

387
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,680
which is again hope middleware follow
pattern

388
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,830
they're lightweight exxon some first

389
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,390
response man hours called with a fully
formed response object so at this point

390
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:16,680
no return which missing Aug 21 harkin

391
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,030
but it's really useful for performance
really stock so

392
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,060
one other quality me response but always
comes built in majengo

393
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,090
it's called national capital where what
that does is

394
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,470
goes textures of the comes back out at
the content like

395
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,690
onto it and looks hot texarkana their
past

396
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,670
if your browser has cash populous ill
just go Irish the whole cock

397
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:42,920
the whole body her response replace it
with an oil change response

398
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,830
so it it's useful for things like that
it's also useful for cock in session

399
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,300
management

400
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,770
if you wanna tak after field said your
cock in her pressure token each time

401
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,930
can do it there too now

402
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,940
the only thing actually defines this as
middleware is it being object with

403
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,170
process response

404
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,350
method so its original question it could
be combined

405
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:07,200
with the other the answer is yes you can
go on package up

406
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,170
are you different middleware hoax into
one object in this case were in a cock

407
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,220
or so it works both as a request our

408
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,090
because it's got that process request it
also works as a responsible

409
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,770
works got that process response or and
this is really handy

410
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,820
except you gotta remember one thing
which is

411
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,090
middleware lashed at the beginning I i
said its order but this is really where

412
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,510
that quite kits how

413
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,780
on the way so when we're dealing with
her quest

414
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,280
where's humidors process to this list
talk

415
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,460
so first we com where and see a ser our
hike

416
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,780
on the way back swear to God if you got
from bottom

417
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,080
talk so first a Commodore and sister

418
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,740
few cock generally this will do the
right thing

419
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,200
but not all it's important when you're
on middleware isn't

420
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,620
have to work together now if you packed

421
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,830
one object limit 1 spot order whereas
action separately

422
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,830
you can exactly

423
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,710
so the last ep on our five-and-a-half

424
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,890
step process is our friend except

425
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:20,850
and it at the bottom its happen because
it's a little different

426
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,190
it is whereas all our other middleware
fire

427
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,710
section middleware is designed on the
fire

428
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,990
really if you've done some yourself

429
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,450
so you only get exceptional work if you
you function itself

430
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,430
calls exception generally what you can
use except software for

431
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:44,030
distracting is going and 600 bucks
system

432
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,360
if you use century which has downstairs

433
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,310
they how can there to go Cafferty
exceptions the concert last summer

434
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,460
to their service hi it only right

435
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,880
fires on tacos and hit like the others
returns

436
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,030
non-urgent scoff but in this case you
almost always water

437
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,310
spot that's when go into some handles it
redirect user back

438
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,930
sorry page if you don't if you get to
the middleware check

439
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,110
just return on for everyone just kinda
check myspace

440
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,740
higher much mayor or may not

441
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,020
which one ok so

442
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,680
at this point were three we've gone

443
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,660
come through whiskey we've gone down
we've gone back up

444
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,020
we've called the response function the
response function has returned effect

445
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,090
nothing terrible text

446
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,490
with costar response which whiskey
standard returning

447
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,140
and the stakes a boxer sir

448
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,050
at the beginning we started with this
first and I was a crow quest

449
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,230
to the host Daniel Agger dot com saying
I want

450
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:55,200
get on slash hella tale and I can accept

451
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,320
and then what we've given act is a two
hundred okay

452
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,540
which came from jericho said being
served by Amtrak's webster

453
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,710
said Scott content-type: Texas now

454
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,590
which is great because we accept he said
except I

455
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,970
it's got a content-length 33 which was
provided by check

456
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,090
response or act Qatar's on and it's got
to first-line

457
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,930
exposure host template in buyer

458
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,310
function a sack lunch says hunter
because that's where

459
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,840
West and mouse to click

460
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,260
now this view itself is not there's not
a lot to it

461
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,940
says too much text but that itself is
where you do interest

462
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,710
that's where you go you call it web
services collar logic

463
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,260
use the stuff underdog engines back
house you for this week

464
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,690
talk but now no matter how hard tic tac
toe

465
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,880
this is the basic structure your quest
the star

466
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,980
higher to go to the web server hey
webster

467
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,860
up your choice which'll committees
whiskey to get tax check 0

468
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,170
once earned Django you got your question
aware

469
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,990
to your earlier solution for he was
gonna handle it not your view middleware

470
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,010
which probably won't use

471
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,980
I'd with your view function actually
does stuff

472
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,309
on the way back at this time done
nothing wrong back to respond

473
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:16,980
were also contact headers gone through
risky gamble

474
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,980
act web server will send a fax to climb
tutorials

475
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:39,490
are any questions there's Mike from
there

476
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:48,690
thank you

477
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:05,730
here
