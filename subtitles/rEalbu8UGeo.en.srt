1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,080
K thank you everyone for coming along to
this first after lunch session at Pike

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,950
on 2014 here in Montreal

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,910
I'll got three really excellent speeches
all lined up for you

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,760
our first presenter is a program and
data scientist based here in Montreal

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,880
she works on strike started team and is
a Colgan is all

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,390
hi ladies Montreal and the Montreal
all-girl back nights

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,099
to speak to us today about diving into
dot with iPod and MacBook

8
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:39,099
and handers please welcome Julia Evans

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,560
I A on sup

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,690
today when I won't talk to you about I'm
I worked on

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,850
added him I'm which means they're good
data on n/a

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,110
heavier but have different tools that I
use right up sometimes eight to dupe

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,210
I'm sometimes is paid on sometimes like
a czar once

14
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,300
I'm and my favorite old two years

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,770
like the things that I enjoy using the
most are paid on Tools

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,790
I enjoy using I find another camp and
this together

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,510
to answer questions up idea and what I
want to explain this talk

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,830
is why they're my favorite on and why
they could maybe be your favorite

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,930
if you don't use them already sup

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,229
on the way to start a structured

21
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:27,850
on against small not gonna get better
apparently

22
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,780
on is step 1: what are another camp and
as

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,030
Michael what do those words man you may
know a little bit already if you watch

24
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,020
ran oppresses

25
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,000
act looking at this morning on most
about time is going to spend

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,240
on practical examples on how to use the
is to answer questions about your data

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,750
and then I'll and would like a little
bit but it's not like where to go next

28
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,540
if you wanted learn more so first
question is like

29
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,520
what are I dunno but and pandas and like
numb pie

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,580
on and like how to this business like
Scientific Inc

31
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,460
computing tools work together on so the
first thing I want to talk about his

32
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,500
iPod lineup

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,580
on so I've read a book is like a
web-based user interface for Python

34
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,360
and everything like why would I want
that right like you can already right

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,380
papon maybe

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,959
on I had a why would you want to be on
the internet

37
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,430
right leg why would you want to be in a
web page so

38
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,320
on the way forever the book works I'm is
around the server on your chin

39
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,840
on and then you will open in your you
notebook

40
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,190
right I'm gonna be really short Emma
instead of listing I to Peters

41
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,660
step I'm the most important thing that

42
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,900
isn't always obvious is when used I've
ever notebook

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,580
you can Ryan like right any paid by code
that you would normally right

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,110
like it's not like a limited by mid
where there are only certain things you

45
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,630
can do

46
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,220
I'm it just paid on like you can do any
pipe on being in the US otherwise do

47
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,260
that you get up connect to databases in

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,340
you can like you do everything right

49
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,169
on so one thing that I really like about
it

50
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:03,400
is like but the important thing and I do
like string dot split

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,190
and I wanna know how it works right
normally you'd look at the documentation

52
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,220
here sees that I've hesitated at like
would you like some documentation

53
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,989
and they pressed have again and the ok
would you like even more

54
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,269
and the press have again exam had a
frustrated and a popular

55
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,510
all the documentation at the bottom
explaining a split works for me

56
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,700
I can like resize it and I didn't have
to leave great

57
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,329
and I didn't have to even know it just
like came up for me

58
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,120
on so funny really useful interactive
tool for doing

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,130
export a work but I do like string not
split

60
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,329
right like this on

61
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:45,040
23 and angular no that wasn't what I
wanted maybe eight celebs put on a comma

62
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,639
OST right so my workload around this is
often I do something

63
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,859
do it wrong as we do I'm and then change
it and I can in to rate really quickly

64
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,810
so that led by the notebook on

65
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,340
the next day on talk about it pandas on
sup

66
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,530
often I will do so kinda did an out this
little have a date is that

67
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,480
with every complaint call ever made in
New York right i'm for fun

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,260
and then I want to know that let's say I
wanna know like

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,620
every hour how many noise complaints
were made

70
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,060
arm except like I would like to sweat it
out Beiber

71
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,370
on and also maybe a lake I only care
about the period connect

72
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,919
temper in December I'm so I do it a lot
of filtering aggregating

73
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,980
I'd you might think about you might have
trailed like if you're reading a program

74
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,510
that would be like something that could
happen I'm with pandas you don't have to

75
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,370
write loops

76
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,110
on and also at like doing something like

77
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,979
IRI on the north by the filtrate things
you don't want and then grab it except

78
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:44,350
like

79
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,690
arm and then grab the number each hour
is like 512 Cup

80
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,130
like that's really come back it's really
easy on

81
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,940
and but it's not like I was there are
obvious how to get started

82
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,440
sudden unexplained about pat is kinda
the tool that lets you do all this

83
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,020
filtering

84
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,060
on and parsing the pandas bill I have
not pie

85
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,880
what is numb by if you want to brendor
the stock yesterday that paper

86
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,660
data structures you will know but if you
ever a pipe bomb blast had like five

87
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,570
million things

88
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,720
if you iterate through that list you
have to make five million object

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,110
which takes time even though computers
are fast so

90
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,300
I A but like thing like number its
pastors kind ever

91
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,820
like it's it's not as I A said again

92
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,090
right so i thought id example an example
as the topic a whole buncha numbers

93
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,630
right

94
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,900
and then find the sum of the squares so
did about Connor ever do like pretty

95
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,850
simple

96
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,910
recently doubled up 1.2 seconds I'm to
add up all the

97
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,400
those numbers squid which is pretty good
right like computers are about that was

98
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,190
a big number

99
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,400
on but if I do to number it takes like
83 mil seconds which is like

100
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,980
like 15 times faster on so when I say
nope I sponsor I mean umpires like 15

101
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,310
times

102
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,200
after another Asian taking about or more
right

103
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,490
um so and the reason it faster is
because it implements all the operations

104
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,630
like it stores your

105
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,220
on deserters alexi areas arms and

106
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,860
bend like when you operate on umpire is
you do it all at once so instead of

107
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,990
being like

108
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,390
reading a for loop you'll be like just
some all these things right

109
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,550
and you just like all number functions a
number i text having

110
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,120
Korea and them as a panda's bill another
number I

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,220
and you'll have panned assumptions which
are built up by functions

112
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,310
so on eyes pandas

113
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,950
inside I'd rather know book and no play
makes and as fast

114
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,600
okay um quick note how to install these
tools

115
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,150
don't use the like nobody packages in
stopping his in pip

116
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,430
or a little girl there's a
distributional anaconda

117
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,420
which I've been super easy to use and I
is a lot on

118
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,750
there yet never use packages like this
these things are evolving supervise the

119
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,800
by the community is doing amazing work
on

120
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,690
and use the latest versions on because
they're amazing

121
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,730
so I'm and you can run a weapon a book
by typing

122
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,660
I played on notebook

123
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,120
it's good and not to hide

124
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,290
on and then when you wanna grab another
you get this little pop-up turning in

125
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,390
your browser

126
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,350
and an evening at started so now I want
to talk about the practical examples

127
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,030
as I promised on so the first thing

128
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,670
I want to but as the date is that we're
going to be using were in Montreal

129
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,470
people it it's a bit cold right now is
much colder a few weeks ago

130
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,720
even when it's very cold people go
biking right um

131
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,680
so we have bike path here I'm their
centers on his bike that that's meant

132
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,010
meant measure the number of cyclists who
are going pass at center

133
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,240
every day on and that did as published
online:

134
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,040
so we can play with it and find out
things about when people go biking

135
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,860
for example do people go biking well as
-20 No

136
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,060
%uh except people do actually

137
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,490
which is what will you know we're going
to get there observers the data that

138
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,570
we're going to be talking about so I
downloaded it

139
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,700
I'm this is not big data rate this is
like

140
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,260
one data point for each day of the year
on

141
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,389
so I don't love the CSB and this is what
it looks like when I started right

142
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,310
hun if you've par CES is before you may
be familiar

143
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,230
with things that you're on um so what
what this is is it one bro for each day

144
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,000
of the year

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,090
I'm has the dates and the number of
cyclists on each

146
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,430
on on its back for and that there's a
man's ear and back that's

147
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,310
so you know is there could be problems
the separator above the common wasn't

148
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,039
home a

149
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,409
right and you may not be impressed with
pandas right now on

150
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,510
so the reason you should be impressed is
you can

151
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,820
also there's a lot of text year but I'm
I get home in two options as agreed the

152
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,480
CSP

153
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,160
the body including his loved one
separators xenical nation expertise to

154
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,209
parse the dates

155
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,579
and her purse today first because we're
not american I'm

156
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:57,389
and he a great day for Canadians I'm it
has all these are

157
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:01,220
these options and there are more options
if you haven't even weirder CST

158
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,589
and like that like the people over a pan
is have bought about this right

159
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:09,490
and they know that may be there like 12
lines at the top UCSD which are relevant

160
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,579
years the SD

161
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:13,999
so there's a skiff option where you can
skip the first time rose

162
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,699
because that happened when I was
downloading weather data from whether

163
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:17,920
died easy .ca

164
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,329
and then it was there on a need to write
code because it was just

165
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:25,069
like an often has recvd is the United on
and is also like

166
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:30,059
read Excel I'm I had a client at at some
point will be like sent as a home in

167
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:34,279
Excel files and it was fine cuz pandas
can read Excel

168
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,670
I'll it's great

169
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,639
on sup so the first thing I do

170
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,809
on so now you know that this is
beautiful right on

171
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,209
I would like that supper minute and talk
about what we're looking at right

172
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:51,990
like I said bike data is variable white
is it

173
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,499
on so but data is a data frame whose is
are

174
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:59,790
before a few if you a day to ramp and is
based on a data plan

175
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,839
are your intuitions are correct on who
hears you single

176
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,170
more view on a day dreams a little bit
like a database table

177
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,180
right there rose their columns on
there's a

178
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:16,970
and exits little bit like your primary
key I'm Zahir the date is the index

179
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,779
and on the way this is stored like the
way it kinda

180
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:24,129
like kinda things about this is it a
bunch of number I raise

181
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:28,379
which are either a which are the columns
I'm to starve them into columns

182
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,149
but its display to you is like a table
altogether like an Excel spreadsheet

183
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:35,620
I did except awesome on

184
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,809
because it's not an Excel spreadsheet
and much easier two years

185
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:41,889
as a programmer so

186
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,309
on to have a datagram om the first

187
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:50,110
operation I wanna show you is even take
the first three rows in a glamorous life

188
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,910
on I'm so that's great

189
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,180
on and let's say 12 plotted you might
think that you have no learn how to use

190
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,290
net problem in learn how to use the
plotting library

191
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,110
that's not true you just had %uh plot
and

192
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,579
on and NBC like we look at this on

193
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:11,869
I would like okay on in the winter in
till March

194
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:15,519
it's really cold outside and no one
really goes by King

195
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,369
and then in the summer people like it
summer this is the best

196
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:23,999
everything is the meaning everyone is
happy as it is not a huge surprise right

197
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:27,970
I'm so don't look if Isaac Plains crap
for a minute I'm

198
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,629
the x-axis is time and the y-axis is
like the number of people biking

199
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,189
on each day and then the different lines
are different bike paths

200
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:40,410
I'm select bury the blue one is bringing
my house century popular iPad even go

201
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,129
very fast

202
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:44,399
the super steep hill on and it's really
fine

203
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,689
and like a little bit dangerous on very
popular

204
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,889
on so let's say a I said that day was
the most popular

205
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:56,939
right I'm but I want like quantify that

206
00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:00,740
and I was at airports like my boss in
charge a bike paths right

207
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,410
I would elected and a letter but given
the median right

208
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,589
on the way to do that is you like a dot
median

209
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:12,050
on and their love is like super help 'em
thanked like matt is upended get the

210
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,040
idea to braums

211
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm per like finding out that is excited

212
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,800
on so am not there then one at the plot
comedians and gobbling up

213
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,689
bar chart does everyone loves bar chart
then I could be like bike data

214
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,540
dot median dot plot I'm

215
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,920
on and then to give me some weird air
pretend that errors in their

216
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,179
I'm that was then had a fun thing on

217
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:38,569
and the dignity that that like very is
the biggest right and then act like this

218
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:40,459
is the best bike rack wish to kill the
other

219
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,550
I don't know like whatever it right now
conclusion you're trying to convince the

220
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,170
people you're bored you board meeting
John this crap

221
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,819
K on a few other things i wanna talk
about

222
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,379
on even take a column place so like
let's say sometimes I have

223
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:57,399
like CST is it had like two billion rows
are like

224
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,220
50 I'm and I only really care about 3 on
you can give

225
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,649
a it a allister broza as an index and is
restricted and to do that

226
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:08,699
I'm and then you can also Lake say eats
it

227
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:12,670
take diversity rose innings with the
surrounding the gimme overseers and then

228
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,850
only his columns doesn't care what order
you do it in pen is nice to you

229
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,059
okay on the last kinda like basic pan

230
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:24,559
like numb hype and this feature want you
to talk about on

231
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,119
is my favorite wanna my favorite I have
many favorites sorry

232
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:33,189
home so on I talked about doing
operations all at once right

233
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:36,459
so let's say I wanted to find all other
days where they're less than

234
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:37,769
seventy-five people biking

235
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,740
on the very back flat near my house
right collect $75 is in a lot

236
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,829
on it's a pretty popular bike path I'm
so what I can do

237
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:49,999
is I can say when is less than
seventy-five and it gives it has long

238
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,259
black churches involved

239
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,410
strain and then what I can do with that

240
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,369
is akin put that into like I can index
with it

241
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:02,119
and it will give me all at the Rose that
satisfy that condition and I can combine

242
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,119
conditions

243
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:06,809
and they can use arbitrarily complicated
conditions so it's like a single query

244
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:08,019
if you've used that

245
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:12,220
except you can write Python code right
on and you can just like do whatever

246
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,509
sickle might allow you to do

247
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:17,179
you can do anything you want and to
Canada arbitrary queries

248
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:21,089
on and you can see it here that like the
days was unable or all days in

249
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:25,110
in January and February January and
February so-called

250
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,910
rights but not a huge surprise

251
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,800
so I'm but super powerful amazed at all
the time

252
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,399
okay so the next question I had on

253
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,550
is I want snow like what all of this
variation was about right like there's

254
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,610
this crap in it like

255
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,499
number of cyclists and I what silly is
this because the weekends like

256
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:50,899
is the variation because more people
back on weekdays on weekends

257
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,420
so here's here's a question like who
thinks that in Montreal where city of

258
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,379
commuters a good to me mostly bike
because we're going to work

259
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,629
some people who picked fifth group we'll
be back for fun

260
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:05,730
these disagreements we can solve with
data

261
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,300
this is the best again overnight his
right

262
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,439
so the first thing I'm gonna do I'm as I
have a datagram

263
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:16,869
I'm gonna add a new column the way add a
new column is like adding a new key to a

264
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:17,649
dictionary

265
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,829
because everything is nice I'm and like

266
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:23,929
his interests were kinda you might
expect on

267
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:27,949
so om tennis is really good a time
series

268
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:31,730
a time series is a fancy word for a
bunch of numbers

269
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,290
which are in next by like a date select
stocks right

270
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,050
I'm it was originally built by by people
who are doing like banja they denounce

271
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,869
this

272
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:43,369
I'm like was beginning on so

273
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:47,839
I had a weekday column and index of
weekday

274
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,649
and that gives me a number rate for HID
the air

275
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:55,110
I meant what I want to do with this is I
want to

276
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,920
on collect all the all other entries
would like the same weekdays like Taylor

277
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,249
everything with with the six

278
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:04,239
I liked at all those up and everything
2008 at all those up

279
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:07,499
and every day at the gay one allied all
those up and then we'll figure out what

280
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,600
the A six and they're actually means

281
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,069
on and then world are pretty graph into
it to our board meeting grady

282
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:19,449
so on

283
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:25,040
want to do that I'm if you'd done whose
use like a single group by

284
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,660
this is like that I'm if you have a
musical group by its what I said

285
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,220
right on you have like all the easier
than you had them up

286
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,850
had on abut like you should think up and
his group I like a single goodbye that's

287
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,449
why it's called

288
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:42,119
at on so we say good bye week day

289
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:45,249
and aggregate although those groups by
taking the Sun

290
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:48,749
you can use any function you want here
Yuki don't just have to use built-in

291
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:49,480
functions

292
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,019
you can write your own functions he's
any function that you find in the wild

293
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:53,929
you can use the miles

294
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,129
you know you can uses any function on

295
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:01,329
so I do this I meant I get a new data
frame which has all of the weekdays

296
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:04,730
as the index and then for each column
add them all up

297
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,049
and it'll work for me and I didn't have
to write a loop

298
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:12,160
because loops our work and we don't like
doing work we like other people to Dr

299
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,089
Acworth

300
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:16,240
are at least idea on right

301
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,709
I'm but like numbers like who likes
reading tables have a lot of numbers

302
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:28,020
some %uh view I'm I I feel you I like
members however I prefer grab

303
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,220
right on so what I did was that his
right index by hand I just looked up

304
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,760
like

305
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,920
iPad a date that was the 0 and they look
to be my calendar

306
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,330
to find out what day of the week it was
and I found out that it was Monday on

307
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,100
because I I want to do it fast

308
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,130
if you were like doing it the right way
you would probably find out some way to

309
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,200
programmatically

310
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,200
and do that I'm tho

311
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,370
attention XD right and it turns out at
Thursday's most popular day

312
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,480
the days of the week Mr popular in the
weekends and it looks like we're

313
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,980
commuters it looks like you back to work

314
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,500
yeah hacer

315
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,640
I'm so that's cool arm and then i buy I
J bar graph

316
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,320
no not that like if you want to plot a
biografia like pot

317
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,870
kind it was bar on that like one in the
main

318
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,740
kinda graphs a draw a lot arm

319
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,700
so that that's good right ion kno to 700
lips to do that right

320
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,520
like that which is like a few lines of
code alright

321
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,590
so but if you look at that this artist
chart again

322
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,870
like there is a little bit a variation
by Dave the week but that's definitely

323
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,350
not like all that's causing the huge
spike

324
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,420
throughout the year right on so

325
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,260
I like to do like a better investigation
into this on

326
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,200
cuz we're like data scientists or
whatever and Anna I'm

327
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,550
so but next thing I want to do is look
at the temperature

328
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,900
right like it's called didn't don't need
to be like

329
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,400
amazing a data statistics magic people

330
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,170
to the hague know that people don't like
going biking when it's called

331
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,360
on so I'm but this function don't look
at this function at kinda big

332
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,290
on but basically what I was doing was
like I went to climb a doubt whether

333
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,490
Dodd d-ct and Mike I found some

334
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,430
Lake place where I could put in things
into the your Alan

335
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,750
ever give me a CSP kinda have and I
could put it together

336
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,960
anyway it was a lot of work is kinda
what I'm trying to say here you can

337
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,540
imagine you could have written us

338
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,350
on I'm an I don't know whether data I
looked at it

339
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,580
and it gave me the temperature every
hour as a good that's good

340
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,360
I'm the main problem with this is that
if you want the temperature every hour

341
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,370
and one of the temperature everyday
right because we only have the bike did

342
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,660
every day

343
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,520
I'm so I decided to take the average
temperature

344
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,420
on and the way you take the average
temperature

345
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,390
is you re sample which apparently some
people do when analyzing like financial

346
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,190
stock data

347
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,210
because they're like I have my stock
prices every like two milliseconds and I

348
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,100
only need them every like 10
milliseconds

349
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,650
I don't know a about hybrid with these
i've been out estimates

350
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,540
on but when I did everything I double so

351
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,080
on but there is ample on resembling is
great you do

352
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,140
daughtry sample and then you get the
time period you want you can read it in

353
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,540
like

354
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,530
you 8d if you want two days you're it 2d
if you want three hours you at 3h

355
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,620
pretty simple on and then use say how

356
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,230
and you can see these days and that mean
when you get a function I'm cuz you can

357
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,080
all miss nicole is dependent think
functions

358
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,700
on so once I'm done that I get them the
average temperature everyday

359
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,770
right and you could argue for like hours
about whether or not this is a useful

360
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,450
thing

361
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,380
like this like the best way to resample
on but we want

362
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,550
you can down the days afterwards and do
a better job than me

363
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,770
that is what I would like sup I'm began
to lick

364
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,800
on January 3rd it was like -14 Southee

365
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,440
celsius which is pretty cold i think is
a good zero Fahrenheit

366
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,860
on if you're American on

367
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,520
so a judge a llegar

368
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,910
of a big bucks for 10 temperature and
you'll see like this

369
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,030
I'm gonna go over there really quickly
on because this is really exciting

370
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,520
to me on up in Rotana okay this bike
here

371
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,640
this within my reach and it went up to
18 degrees

372
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,120
and it was beautiful and I missed it and
all of my friends were like

373
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,590
all in a son Nathan I was up 5 nose ring
a tank top and a mini mart

374
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,970
Jan I was like why do I miss it

375
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,620
I'm anyway it was like kind in her death
but I get the temperature went up super

376
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,270
high and everyone went up by King evelyn
was so excited

377
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,770
and then went down again unlike
nevermind whenever their bike away get

378
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,930
right leg

379
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,230
I'm as he can feel like there there's
like a real correlation here

380
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,660
right but the rest a bit I don't know
Lake I'm I'm not like as stalled on like

381
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,940
the other specs Nisga'a

382
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,040
just kinda that one in March are there

383
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,160
I'm but that's cool we've done finance
him

384
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,220
by which I mean looking at Grafton point
and

385
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,250
not a real scientist so on

386
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,420
right so now the next question was like

387
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:19,210
there's more variation here right Lake
similar to go but it's raining

388
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,340
let's look at some precipitation

389
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,330
so I want snow like what percentage of
each day was it raining

390
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,190
right and here you might again bank and
we if we look at our original

391
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,610
on data weather data frame year

392
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,790
it doesn't give us like Arrhenius
quotient it says like

393
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,560
a string which is the weather right I'm
so you might think you have to do work

394
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,110
here

395
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:46,870
and you'd be wrong because pandas knows
everything

396
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,030
so palaces all is magical string
functions so what you say is like

397
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,860
look at the weather and then go to like
the bunch of singing bhajans

398
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,310
and Philip does contain rain and then it
gives you one yr 0

399
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,620
depending on whether or not it contains
a string rain and it does everything for

400
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,280
you

401
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,490
arm so a menu sample that again every
day

402
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,230
I'm so we get like the percentage hours
a day when it was raining right

403
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,230
like whether or not that's right thing I
don't now right maybe

404
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,330
arm and then we get this other guy a I'm
like this happens a lot less clear to me

405
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,660
on there's some spikes over here

406
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,810
where like like this one

407
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,910
and over here Lake maybe that correlates
like a spike down where they can kind of

408
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,280
see it like

409
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,460
like it like like this her and bit but
like also like pointing at

410
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,770
a spikes in grasses like a really
dangerous things to do in analyzing data

411
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,070
is not a good practice and because you
like you can just like over Pitt

412
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:49,130
with your brain a lot cuz we're really
good technique patterns that are there

413
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,650
on so it is better to look at a
correlation I'm with you could also do

414
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,200
but we're not going to do

415
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,530
on because this is all I have to say

416
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,190
madame applied yet I'm worth it the
glove save our practical example

417
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,310
right on this wasn't a lot of code

418
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,650
is the main when I wanna make rain on
except for the weather thing which is

419
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,680
like a disaster

420
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,870
but pretend that didn't happen home and
there were no group right

421
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,750
like we made these graphs to make we
found out if it be hindering me

422
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,050
like resample than we did others can't
kinda cool stuff

423
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,920
I mean after it leaves we had really up
to like six lines of code right

424
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,070
including reading in the data I was
super easy

425
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,260
on and raised experiment SEM

426
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,470
a beloved Xperia on if you want to be
using these tools

427
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,720
on I find it super useful 3some the
documentation

428
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,040
a minute on a documentation on and

429
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,230
what I often find is already considering
I learn a little bit

430
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,130
and the model look at the darkness Albin
things like totally helps Bionic I wish

431
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,060
I knew about that like six months ago

432
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,610
answers good girl looking a little bit
from time to time and brush up

433
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,430
a month you learned from the basics and
is a good issues PDF and really good API

434
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,420
documentation

435
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,420
I really enjoy it I'm was begin even at
a company

436
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,360
108 houses which I enjoyed has led a
really great examples

437
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,700
on one of the main most important things
is like

438
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,350
always ready use like these built-in
operations really dari sample

439
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,520
or like I'm things that have been built

440
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,900
these are built in on because Rainier on
dips is

441
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,230
a lot of %uh get merv your work I mean
BB

442
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,900
really slow it'll be like 20 times lower
I'm as we saw before

443
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,640
right and it's a bit like it doesn't
matter everything a second but if you

444
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,290
doing a real big competitions

445
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:37,010
that a problem on and

446
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,330
though you can if you really need to do
some custom competition you can use

447
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,400
tools like site on

448
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,650
on tutor to like right things that are
compiled see an actual on quickly

449
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,330
and that's pretty approachable and I've
done it before I kinda like Google two

450
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,100
examples and dived into the pen is risk
getting pulled from the ad and copy

451
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,550
didn't

452
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,910
messed with it and worked I'm its that
pretty virtual to do that

453
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,080
on but it's easier to avoid doing that
and he's gotten back to me whenever

454
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,050
possible

455
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,050
on and often where things are happening

456
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:08,050
on one thing that I did is I may depend
as cookbook if you wanna get started

457
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,810
I mister evans get have repository and
there's like 10 chapters which are like

458
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,910
differently like small example the
things that you can

459
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,660
do it panders together with like
practical examples to this this is data

460
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,520
said there's some other data says the
years

461
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,060
to kind of show off some has kept its
capabilities on

462
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,090
and is a few and take a look at that it
could contribute to it also

463
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,090
and examples like how to use it with
lexical databases

464
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:36,100
on and that might be a place get started

465
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:43,100
and method

466
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,409
and it's fantastic

467
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:49,549
on sorry if there are any questions for
Julia

468
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:53,200
upcoming lineup at this microphone that
with cleverly placed here

469
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,850
front of the room I will just give few
moments for like you to form

470
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,769
right this question thank you

471
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:06,380
going and mint

472
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:13,380
effectiveness prior different

473
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:16,830
actors said

474
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,830
that's really the question I guess I
think them as a look at the database

475
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,389
queries

476
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,710
I'm Xavier if you think that it be
through that little affiliate group

477
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,990
based way picking up thanks

478
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:31,490
on and if you're not I wanna lick the
more you practice it

479
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,529
the better get that like a not a very
good answer her

480
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:38,450
I

481
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,250
where's likes like it learn into this
the slides

482
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,350
to nigga psyche learn

483
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:51,000
another up oh yeah I talked with a
cabana abstract I'm

484
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,870
so like not by individual a second I'm

485
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,260
so anytime you want to use if you wanna
division in on your plan is it depends

486
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,130
I'll just work

487
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,130
on soap and if you feel like getting our
asses

488
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,510
secular modeling yes a gallon for
modeling

489
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,760
yet if you wanna make a matte model you
can bikes and like a pat is a demanding

490
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,120
but

491
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,230
and that'll that'll work seamlessly I'm
a time that I do

492
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,649
yeah I'm

493
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:19,860
so first of this looks like a lot of fun
cuz I said he's been releasing a lot of

494
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,870
open data lately

495
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:26,039
on but candid can this do geographical
stuff graphical stuff

496
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,570
or geographic to grab gotta that's a
good question I don't think that panders

497
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,789
does do graphical stuff by itself I

498
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:37,799
don't know that's chip not that I know
of on

499
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,179
but there are really good tools that
have seen

500
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,309
I'll get yep I couldn't I can tell you
something later

501
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:49,529
okay appreciate the talk

502
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:54,429
up quick question on customizing hype

503
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:59,070
different custom ship

504
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,370
was wondering if you had if you
customize

505
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,830
I'd recommend

506
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,299
surgeon mean that customers in people's
pockets

507
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:15,370
no customizing the actual con as
understood

508
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,700
customized tooth

509
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,940
different hype okay

510
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,110
even exam you would like interactive
JavaScript things and I found the

511
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,690
notebook

512
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,750
arnelle a different option %uh

513
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,049
so the edges I don't know I think the
answer there now but I would love to see

514
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:41,049
yeah I don't do that how do you make
sure the conclusions make

515
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:45,169
become

516
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:48,559
the attic the answer to that is like
learnt this is text

517
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,600
and acquire friend to know statistics

518
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,460
on yeah on

519
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,309
I don't want to say too much about the
curricula go embarrass myself

520
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:04,750
but on one thing you can do is be

521
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,470
really careful about what did he look at

522
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,340
Cilic so for example you don't wanna
lick look at data and the like

523
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,970
take up points a finger in dressing like
I was doing great what I was doing was a

524
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,700
terrible thing to do

525
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,720
right you can do that on my Hindu

526
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,600
is like think about the question they
are asking carefully before you look at

527
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,169
the data

528
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:26,190
on and I think that's a good way yeah
like

529
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,270
ok asking the question after you look at
the data is about choice

530
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,639
because then like you'd like me to
question right and the DS question for

531
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:33,389
you look at the deer

532
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:39,480
benefit a better chance like doing the
job Boyd

533
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,679
hearing your experience these years into
this this topic

534
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:49,679
everyplace like Julie Evans for talks

535
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:54,610
