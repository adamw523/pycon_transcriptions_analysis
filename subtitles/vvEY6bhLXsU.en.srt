1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,660
with that our next speaker is Tabish
Armstrong

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,170
attempt is a sovereign young student at
Concordia University

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,360
last year he added the performance have
open source applications

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,650
a collection of essays about
optimization written by the maintainers

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,190
various

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,199
open source projects it is pretty beefy
noles nusa Syria's

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,859
are that if you buy all the proceeds go
to Amnesty International's II super

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:23,600
recommended

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,240
am so please give a warm welcome to
Tavish we'll be talking about

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,990
suffer injury research for hackers
bridging the two solitudes

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,680
thanks

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,620
is this on aka

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,460
thanks for coming and I wanted to start
up by

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,079
thinking Dana Bauer who encouragement a
similar talk proposal the pike on

15
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,190
I A yeah and so you have her to blame if
this goes badly in you have her to think

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:54,980
if it goes well

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,000
two-minute room in talk for you

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,260
and first light min talk mood with the
star gazer

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,640
at using data analysis to

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,030
a analyzes the open source projects that
we work on

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,250
to learn more about how the development
process works

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,380
and learn more about how we work I think

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,729
this can help us make smarter decisions
Abboud

24
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:21,740
how we program and a

25
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,700
incur to serve better more productive
conversations about this

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,229
so fundamentally the sarcasm

27
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:34,740
conversations to vote what we tell each
other's trooper programming and now we

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,259
decide

29
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:39,280
you know on this knowledge what we know

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,090
and how we know it I was reading a book
on how scholars on the

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,100
and this line junto a mi

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,939
it surprised me is it Iran to an
important aspect of her skills power

33
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:57,259
lies in the compactness and the code we
rape compared to working in popular

34
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,420
traditional languages

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,820
when we develop it has girl we often
very much less code and substantially

36
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,590
less time

37
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,229
and with fewer bugs this is an
interesting statement because

38
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,930
as far as I could tell the author is I'm
basing this completely on

39
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,680
intuition on their experience which is
great we should talk about it

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,580
on the experience so we have reading
software and compare let other people's

41
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,590
experiences and this is a totally valid

42
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,250
thing to do but it's a limited use

43
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,180
not everybody agreed to me in the
comments section actually

44
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,849
I'm challenges person the my impression
is that how schools ranking factor

45
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,319
averages around four but obviously very
is allowed

46
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,300
this is a surprising amount of precision
for some years also

47
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,959
making this number up and

48
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,599
that's okay I mean we're talking about a
our experiences writing software and its

49
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,790
um this is how this person feels

50
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,500
but wouldn't be so much better if we
knew

51
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,180
whether or not this is true we knew this
was truly we know something more about

52
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,409
how software works

53
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:10,530
if we knew that it took less time to
rate house coco maybe we would

54
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,069
switch to Haskell I don't know so this
isn't about somebody being wrong on the

55
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:16,670
Internet

56
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:23,670
the vote so you could be more right on
the Internet we say a lot of things to

57
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:25,810
each other that

58
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,940
arm you know if they were true if we
actually a

59
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,409
evidence for them I think we would act
differently you probably heard somebody

60
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:33,849
say

61
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,069
papon's more readable than other
languages you know

62
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,540
behind if you think this is true core

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,590
on I actually think this is true but you

64
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,360
we could do usability testing on
languages and find out which ones

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,939
are actually more readable do that
forward different

66
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,580
kinda programmers novices we're experts
or whatever and

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,620
if we know this then you know the next
series languages that were inventing

68
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,790
want know how to do that better you know
we can talk about unit testing whether

69
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,090
or not it's useful

70
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,709
I'm python is a good for beginners
that's an interesting question

71
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,090
if python is actually better for
beginners we should

72
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,139
teach I don't beginners it and

73
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,229
this notion that happy for hours make
better programmers I'm

74
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,080
like these are old if we knew that these
were true we would act differently I

75
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,470
think

76
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,639
we're talking about could review
weekends a lot of things like this like

77
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,949
a lot of people recommend that you keep
your paddle slow

78
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,110
on some people think that could reviews
was nitpicking

79
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,210
when we look at code review in the wild

80
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:47,840
and see whether or not this in the true
see how big patches usually are

81
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,250
to phenomenally were talking about it
facts that have no foundation

82
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,940
the race on intuition and based on
rationalizing what we feel

83
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,110
and there is value in that

84
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,020
people who do science really get this
right when they make claims

85
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,550
they need evidence to make those claims
and

86
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,240
if their claim that they're just kinda
taking for granted when they're doing

87
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,310
the research maybe somebody else is
already

88
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,810
convince them that something is true
then their citations to that

89
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:26,539
they tell you where you can also be
convinced that these things are true

90
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:31,580
but works pretty well can we do that in
our communities can we do that for

91
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,780
software engineering

92
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,690
we do benchmarks to test performance we
usability tests are you eyes

93
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,440
we use analytics on our websites

94
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,060
so when we turn these in

95
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,020
this kinda inquiry on our souls

96
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,900
I think will be happier and better
programmers that we did those

97
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,569
the person you got me interested in this
topic was Greg Wilson gave a great talk

98
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:05,240
to other student conference

99
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,090
and 2010 called what we actually know
what software development and

100
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,410
why we believe it

101
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,660
thanks um we talked about it he talked
about it

102
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,000
and through cutting-edge suffering
research

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,190
um through what academics who research
software developers know about house of

104
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,419
parliament works

105
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,009
you put together a book called making
software where every chapters

106
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,180
written by researchers who you do this

107
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:40,229
nasa's or are doing a survey of existing
else's

108
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,470
covers topics like officers you know
should you keep arm

109
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,370
each should you have private offices for
developers should you have a complaint

110
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,610
I'll

111
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,690
open-plan offices and what kinda
situations

112
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,710
are these useful

113
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,009
0 is per pair programming useful me the
more more useful question is in what

114
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,960
situations is a useful

115
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,830
and is a cost-effective to have to
developers working on the same thing

116
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,460
the talk about modern could review and
how it actually works

117
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,349
and really interesting chapters on
failure prediction using

118
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,470
organizer organizational structure the
developers working on the code

119
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,789
so what that showed was that on

120
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:23,000
the a the number above that would be

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,830
caused by a file had more to do with the
communication structure of the people

122
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,770
working on the

123
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,900
on that code then things like

124
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,229
test coverage or I'm complexity metrics
were

125
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:38,599
any of the things that we talk about so
often it was how the developed with the

126
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:40,020
social structure

127
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,150
that's out on top in the technical
structure that was more important

128
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,000
great also added a blog called The it
will never again to your blog

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,720
where the summer as researchers the
COMESA in

130
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,870
you know in words that aren't completely
eliminating two people actually write

131
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,280
code

132
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,789
it's a it's a great blog you should
check it out

133
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,180
min ago for some interesting papers that
I think our chemical on teachers

134
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,569
in things we don't know about software
or maybe we thought we knew but

135
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,810
we outline a performer so

136
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,110
here's an example what can we learn
about could review I just mention that

137
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,360
people like to savings because review
and

138
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,610
might not actually have any evidence for
it

139
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,270
security who was my supervisor last
summer and Chris Chambers who

140
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,810
as with a Microsoft Research published a
paper called converge in contemporary

141
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,490
software purity packed practices live
very basic statistics on

142
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,990
a couple large open source products and
some closers products including being in

143
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,719
SQL Server and circum- comparing the
weather could really work on these

144
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,849
products

145
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,390
as you might think that open source
projects were differently than so being

146
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,830
or something like that

147
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,260
this is assertive violin parts

148
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,700
looking at pipe sizes on its products so

149
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,209
the sizeof the patch they get similar to
a code review system

150
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:04,339
and their pretty similar across all
these products

151
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:07,440
the very between 45 and 150

152
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,920
certainly if you're working on these
projects you want to keep your such a

153
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,550
small

154
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,240
and it's interesting that on all these
particular converging on this practice

155
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,320
it might mean that it's a good thing my
part but

156
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,149
it it's certainly something that we
didn't know before

157
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:27,089
this is some learn it looks heard on how
long it takes for the first reviewer to

158
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,399
take a look at the pageant where you at
and

159
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,000
they're pretty similar across the board
%uh this is the number view

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,430
reviewers at each patch gets so the
notion that many eyeballs

161
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,850
make all the shallow I don't know if
that's true but

162
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,550
it seems like to eyeball are sorry for
eyeballs

163
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,930
seem to work in most cases or at least

164
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,570
if you are more eyeballs the stop early
being effective

165
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,620
a some researchers from Waterloo a
handle and friends

166
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,410
in 2006 they did what i think is really
cool here they they took sort of

167
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,079
contribution data on some answers for
the concluding once you all

168
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,560
and they did offer a transformer these
events

169
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,970
and if you do that and you plus
spectrogram other you can troops you the

170
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,870
you can detect periodicity in the data
you can

171
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,430
duties owed some structure Adam what you
think is the

172
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,329
disorganized open source product so with
open source it's often not

173
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:29,350
there is structured it's just hidden and
sort of explicit as it would be a

174
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,820
and closers I get agreements hard

175
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,529
writing papers they're reading papers
and fun let's write some code instead

176
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,290
so in September I to on a Friday night
when I am I think

177
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,470
I made this a I dunno book using a toy
to a bill called get touches on to

178
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,240
pollute

179
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,640
could committed a from A+ from the I
don't project

180
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,300
his pen is to analyze this data and I
had one question which was you know how

181
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,260
long does it usually take to review a
posh

182
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,980
on I Python you know the result is this
plot

183
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,010
you can see that they're usually pretty
fast

184
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,589
and this was like really simple it took
me in an hour

185
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:13,519
um and you lose a lot of fun we don't
really know that much about it

186
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,440
how I played on polar bus work now to be
clear this is not mind-blowing research

187
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,839
but we know something we didn't before
and

188
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,519
put this on the internet and cable some
very generously call this the future

189
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,399
software engineering I'm flattered um

190
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,940
Fernando Perez poster as well and you
can see that

191
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,440
you know it's on you know in the
thousands agree to it but %um people

192
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,579
people read it and they acknowledge that
it existed

193
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:43,630
0 which I thought was pretty cool cuz
they just gonna do this on a Friday

194
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,440
night

195
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,800
I was looking at those with a friend and
talking about this weird Mathai

196
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,360
but it done wrong and we look at the
code and

197
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,389
you know he pointed out the problem in a
fix that and so now that this lake

198
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:02,240
pseudo paper that I have online as it's
been

199
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,470
it it's had a book expert to apply to it

200
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,820
some report my repository and then ran
it on their own product and another the

201
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,950
rent on their own project because

202
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,269
I got this bug report the tool that I
wrote to

203
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,540
purse get logs was choking on

204
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,829
this person's product which was simply
the the symbolic

205
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:27,540
math library for Python minute and it
was breaking because somebody who

206
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:34,490
contributes a semi has an accent in
their name

207
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,139
so I picked up on and then I was
interviewing for a job recently

208
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:43,149
and on the ass for a simple no book
showing like how I do details

209
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:46,740
something that's and they said oh this
is pretty cool

210
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,410
and why don't you try doing the nozzles
like this

211
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,260
the user model called lifelines to plot
on the kaplan-meier curve which

212
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,389
should've

213
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,399
is much better way of looking at how
long it takes for the things to get

214
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,399
merged

215
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,579
so this little experiment I did people
rather

216
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,170
the reproduced a they fixed it improved
on it

217
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:16,350
that sounds a lot like science

218
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,360
so that was fun a couple months later
the

219
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,980
International Conference on software
engineering a few people publish a paper

220
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,139
on something very similar they look to
purpose over

221
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,829
hundreds love reproduction I get home

222
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:35,329
and they found the some other things
they they could find on that you a

223
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:37,720
personable herb butter merge within
three days

224
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,380
3 percent emerge within an hour and Sony
personable purple our bus

225
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,949
were merged you know this is for that
sucks a

226
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:48,959
Ruby product at the that they were
working on

227
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,440
this is me and they also bill the
decision tree based on

228
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,639
through what factors actually affect
what patches get merged

229
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,190
they found that the most significant
doctor was how active the area affected

230
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,699
by the patch

231
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,600
has been recently so if you are trying
to get a patch into the system that is

232
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,449
being modified a lot by other people
right now you can have a hard time

233
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,329
the size of the product was an important
factor and the number files changed by

234
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:16,019
the polar ice was also important so if
you're making a blurb us you should

235
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:16,949
probably try to

236
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:20,240
on place few files as possible on this
is something that people a

237
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,880
sale I like this is useful place that we
already know if

238
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,510
we write software but now we actually
know it

239
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,360
so here's another interesting question a
lot of issues get

240
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,019
and you know how do people Andrew
individuals use get differently

241
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,730
my friend Julie able to stool that you
can arm you you

242
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,510
taper one-liner bash thing into your
terminal

243
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,100
and up up with the results to reserve
your

244
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,279
and will generate you were directed
graph like this

245
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,870
shows what commands you use her
frequently and

246
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,570
on what command you most are most likely
to use after you

247
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,070
do that come in so after eight commit

248
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,459
I most likely to push that whether rosa
fat

249
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:14,529
we can look at julie is graph

250
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,180
we can talk about why it looks different
than mine if

251
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,680
arm it my friend Greg really doesn't
like get

252
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,899
I can look at his draft look at my craft
and see what's different about his

253
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,209
maybe I can suggest something that he
should look into

254
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:34,220
and maybe this will make him happier get
user who knows maybe lost cause

255
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,420
muzzle other taking this very seriously
there on tronic likes to read our data

256
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,959
from all over the organization

257
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,440
and the 10 answer questions like and

258
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,110
why do people give Missoula why do they
lose contributors

259
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,750
if we know why people are leaving the
product we can

260
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,209
key people happier thing this is
something that we should strive for

261
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:03,750
think

262
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,009
so here's an interesting project idea I
think people have looked into this

263
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:07,980
before but

264
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm it could be fun to get started

265
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,990
this committee has been pretty famous
recently

266
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,579
this is the commit that added that her
plea but to open as a sole

267
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,500
and I don't know if you can read the
date on the back but it's

268
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,149
December 31st and I'm not sure where

269
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,120
this person is by it looks like it was
pretty late in the evening

270
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,220
a New Years Eve

271
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,060
can we look at the project so we work on
look at arm look at all the bugs

272
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,829
see when they were committed and can we
learn something about

273
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:49,040
you know when bugs are most likely to be
committed

274
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,279
if we know something about this week and
maybe stop committing stuff

275
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:57,180
after 4 p.m. when retired

276
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,790
and there's a really interesting talk by
Michael fathers on answer on this topic

277
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,589
is on a lot of course talks like this

278
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:06,110
and you can do things like Paul um

279
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,679
through architectural elements additive
software just by looking at what files

280
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,079
are committed together

281
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,309
and i think is look at this issue as
well

282
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,660
so we have all this data and we're doing
science on a

283
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,860
we learn things the software development

284
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,049
and I think we can also build tools
using Stata

285
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,049
the I I built this model call get to
Jason which alters analyze the data

286
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,260
but if you have that tool then you can
build something like it coach which

287
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:38,419
a Mike Williams a little it looks at
what files you commit together

288
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:41,960
and before you commit you say get coach
and it

289
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,360
tells you oh you've modified upset about
high file

290
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,450
maybe also want to modify your history
File

291
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,090
because they look like you're but make a
release

292
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,370
we could build something like Pearland
so when you make up a request for

293
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,289
project looks at how big it is

294
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,090
it looks a I'm how many files in touch

295
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,370
how poorly written the description is

296
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,530
something like that and we can

297
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,150
give scientifically valid suggestions on
how to

298
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,549
make better pitches this would save

299
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:21,010
reviewers time and would serve others
time

300
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,530
so what I want you to do as I want you
to go out there

301
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,049
study the software that you pray

302
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,330
teachers friends something cool that you
learned about house offered a woman

303
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,610
works

304
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,140
back up with evidence share what you
learned with others

305
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,429
upload I paper notebooks tell people
that you're doing this

306
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:47,429
build on the work that other people are
doing bill tools to make this easier

307
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,080
would would really like

308
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,919
is if in Pike honor 2015 which is going
to be here next year

309
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,490
on something as audience to give a talk
on what they learn from software

310
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,610
I want you to go do this and give a talk
on us next year and I'll come

311
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:14,610
and I be really excited about that so
thanks

312
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,030
maybe so much I'm super fired up by this
I we have

313
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,429
a time for questions there's only one
mike is over here's a pic please cue up

314
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:27,210
over here

315
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:34,160
hi I have mean a question as much is a
statement but the purulent

316
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,640
ideas a really good one and I have a
project that I've been working on Kyle

317
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,380
called inverter that will that does PR
went

318
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,020
and and it does it more on a source code
basis rather than

319
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,150
as a run things like happy and this
kinda

320
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,020
static analysis tools against report was
made comments as appropriate

321
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,510
and an I would love to talk in or maybe
it and some sort of open space

322
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,710
on this topic totally done on I'm gonna
put some notes on

323
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,120
at this URL and if you send me emails
because stuff they are working on

324
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,750
I will post to my blog I will tweet
about it and and yeah if you think this

325
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,559
stuff is cool

326
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:17,720
we should be friends because they don't
think there are that many of us

327
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,200
hi thanks for an interesting talk I've
been reading

328
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,400
code complete and through the course of
a couple views and its

329
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,110
and really interesting to see just how
many studies there are about

330
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,350
software practices when so often we hear
is just

331
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,059
conjecture and but

332
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:40,610
I'm just wonderin United

333
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,720
I think this is the kind of thing where
it's been a self-fulfilling prophecy

334
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,230
some other time

335
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,600
and added the you know

336
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,320
the culture is a determines how people
go about things so we tell each other

337
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,690
you know shorter pull requests a better
I

338
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,480
therefore there are more smaller pull
requests

339
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,630
therefore if you stay that you find that
there are more small upon request so

340
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,440
it's not common organic

341
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,299
thing where that come bro and especially
the

342
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,750
with Python for example the the design
and the language

343
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,799
a favors certain things and that make it

344
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,549
you know harder to you go about things
in a different way so you gonna see

345
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:29,409
you know more the thing that the
language favors if that makes sense

346
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:32,559
so I'm just curious about how you think
that interacts with like

347
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,360
and studying these kinds of things

348
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,909
so one thing that's interesting but this
is you know research setting and change

349
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:41,900
in with every threat software Berken

350
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,330
changing that thing that we're studying
in space idea and that's them

351
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,840
usually not a good thing for

352
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,610
the issue a vote on like why we merge
pull request and why we don't

353
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,730
as a good question really be we probably
merge

354
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,820
trip older post because we keep telling
each other that we prefer

355
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,150
we merge for poor person on us early
because

356
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,690
their actual users review

357
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,100
Vera we got a letter

358
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,559
another question I I find this is really
fascinating and it is an anecdote

359
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,409
someone other contributors to twisted

360
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:20,600
and twisted his front with for a long
time we really struggled with

361
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,190
on having enough review bandwidth to get
through I love the

362
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,400
and contributions that people are making
and deserve an informal observation that

363
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,230
a way that we tried to incentivize
people to

364
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,039
you heavy informally observed as we try
to incentivize people to do reviews by

365
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,020
creating this

366
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,720
and little a bit high scores list and
you get points for various kinda

367
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,830
contributions in particular reviews

368
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,260
and it's surprising how and motivated

369
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,820
p at least I A B come to if I have an
opportunity to get

370
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,450
to the top of the leaderboard as this is
actually really effective it was the

371
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,740
community if you think it might

372
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,640
work for year your community as well and
is also reminds me i think im

373
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,580
that the sea Python keep damn near
corner elders are also me actually right

374
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,460
now there's a thread on Python dad about

375
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,700
and struggling with not having enough
for you can with I bet that if we had

376
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,130
data on where in that to Bible life
cycle

377
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,799
things stalled and if we actually could
look at how bad the numbers are

378
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,960
that would really kick ass in a biit
about addressing

379
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,580
and those weakest link so I think a
project that I O

380
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,500
wanna pursue an hour I'll do a poster on
to next year's you can come and look at

381
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,340
it is

382
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,929
and pulling out on this data for core
price on and on

383
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:36,950
given the number is trying to make those
numbers better

384
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,400
so they can go

385
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,020
hello i think is a really important
questions that year

386
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,309
exploring arm I've also been doing a

387
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:53,740
report on 'em have new emerging open
source project to try to

388
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,240
understand you know how the dynamics of
the community are working

389
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,400
%um both looking at get have data as
well as looking at

390
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,059
I'm in a mailing list data on and I was
talking with

391
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:08,100
a friend some who's doing is master's
thesis at UC berkeley

392
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,190
telling about is the questions that I
wanted to answer and he said oh I'm

393
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,210
I'm working on it I'm building a tool
right now that can in a purse through

394
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:16,980
mailing list

395
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,200
archives and figure out all kinds us

396
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,330
%um things about how people make
decisions on who the influencers are in

397
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,279
a community in

398
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,900
and so weird you know where is the code
is a go it's not ready yet

399
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,429
in you know it it occurred to me that is
probably a lot I really really really

400
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,200
amazing research has been done in
academia

401
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,590
and that researchers not really getting
out to the community in

402
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,130
me sir touched on this in your talk with
him QCB have any

403
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,130
thoughts about how that could be

404
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,230
shared with the wider open source
community so that we years

405
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:53,000
practitioners can actually use that data
to

406
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,090
become better what we do

407
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:01,080
this is an interesting topic for sure II
did research in a lab last summer

408
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,779
and a you know the sort of code that

409
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:08,610
I'm gets written in that environment is
home operate generously billy gets

410
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,789
it's not think

411
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:14,809
very stable taught maintained um
nobody's

412
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:18,100
checking to see if it actually works

413
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,340
I'm but I think click in this community
we cabal you the things more

414
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,770
and I think the more tools that we build
do the stuff rate

415
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:33,159
more assertive immature and also that we
do pictures to see if we can kinda

416
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,429
you trick people into kiddie into using
our tools and

417
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:39,900
gonna doing this stuff better by to
gonna be in by example

418
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,390
showing them how we want it to be done
and then have them actually do the hard

419
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,360
work

420
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,600
that make sense maybe some I place my
notebooks with best practices for Howard

421
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,600
how to do this analysis

422
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,710
yeah go thanks

423
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,159
thanks hi arm

424
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,210
yeah I like science I like programming
and

425
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,250
I like the intersection others arm and I
agree that your collections great

426
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,360
Mike asking are versus Oregon

427
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,900
applies scientific thinking to the top
so excited about

428
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,590
and learn new things from them given how
little research there

429
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:22,029
is on seventh making more of that

430
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:25,669
%ah scenes really important but the same
time like

431
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:29,029
there are some bindings within academia
that answer at least

432
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:32,210
a few for questions or at least give
hints at the retraction

433
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,590
but those findings don't seem to get
disseminated

434
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,750
and so we have myths about programming
they've been debunked for decades but

435
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:44,799
still get you know show up for the
Chilean like agnew's threads

436
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,679
so it's like it's like we need a
programming snoops dot com

437
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:51,870
a for like debunking things that are
just like

438
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,870
known to be false or like known to have
no evidence

439
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,020
her for them and so it's like

440
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,230
I kinda ring wondering like how
committee via

441
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:06,460
evangelicalism happen how like what
resource

442
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,059
could we use to make awareness up the P
result we do have

443
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:14,230
a more prevalent so it touched on this
earlier with

444
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,080
comes on the work to Gregs been doing
you know the total number into your blog

445
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,860
making software 'em I think

446
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,039
encouraging programmers who are curious
to

447
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,370
read papers is great doesn't work

448
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:33,340
a.m. the you implicit

449
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,210
approach in taking as the I think

450
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,299
that stuff is light user to engage with
and

451
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:43,559
you probably understand it better if you
try to do some other yourself like the

452
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,020
best way to understand the study is to
try to reproduce that

453
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,919
so I can I want to get people in this
community doing some innocent souls

454
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,580
and so that you know the star asking
these questions and and

455
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,450
and they can go and look up a paper that
already answer their question

456
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,760
occurs related so you know week we we
like it when other people have answered

457
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,330
questions for us already

458
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,350
was also a really good book called some
facts and policies a

459
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:13,059
saw for ensuring both rubber glass which
serve is a bit like snow to come to that

460
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:17,039
exhibit all but on it does go over lakes
through commonly

461
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,720
a.m. repeated myths

462
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,520
did answer your question on the shitter
ago

463
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,630
a so is it it was fascinating the candy
collected

464
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,730
what you've looked at is basically
meta-data

465
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,880
about changes and software you put it

466
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,899
you know what the numbers a files paldon
committed in

467
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:40,080
maybe the number of lines have you
considered

468
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,640
already know anybody who has looked at
sort of the actual data

469
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,669
there's a commit it has you know a
particular deaf but that def

470
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:51,640
is about certain sort of code constructs
and it either

471
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,289
you know get review quickly a dozen
targets approved or it doesn't get

472
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:57,480
approved or gets reverted or it doesn't

473
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,720
based on you know something about the
structure the code

474
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,309
itself that goes into their comment

475
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:10,659
and Anderson question sir am you know
like

476
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:15,240
now I driving example but I am you know
is a

477
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,880
revision to a method within a class more
likely

478
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,000
more or less likely to be accepted then

479
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,700
a revision to function by itself

480
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,350
or you know I remove the variable is
that more or less likely to be accepted

481
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,010
than a

482
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,919
change about math formula or something

483
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,190
user these are just questions so

484
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,779
I i don't have a good answer to lick the
specific thing that you're saying

485
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,899
but one thing the I'm some people have
looked at is

486
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:49,159
unlike some people been doing code
complexity measures and slightly curly Q

487
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:53,250
you probably heard mccabe complexity and
stuff like that for measuring like how

488
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,080
complex

489
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,409
PC softwares and some people looked at

490
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:01,289
inside looking at I'm you know the code
as a static Pisa

491
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:05,600
solid object it through appreciates that
arms of urs in motion

492
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,730
so looking at home with the culture meh
tricks like how much a file has been

493
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,299
changed like how much activity

494
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:14,450
gets and his son to the

495
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,630
like they tend to predict bugs more so

496
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,080
like this tells us that the software

497
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,130
being moderately modification is more
dangerous than

498
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,240
like reading her in the first place

499
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,940
yeah it is there's always however
questions you need to do some open

500
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,919
spaces later D closing ceremonies are in
10 minutes in the keynote

501
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,649
space thank you again 10 ish
