1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,420
well over the line thank you for
attending

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,620
I am I would like to present our next
speaker

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,650
who is Jeff skank who is going to be
talking about

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,580
straightening out angler JS with Python
be round of applause place

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,270
hello

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,650
thanks all for being here on I'm

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,740
really excited to be appearing from you
all on I'm going to be walking you

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,519
through

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,829
I really basic and

10
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,290
kind of starter implementation of what
you would do to take angular JS

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,840
and integrate it with a python back and
on

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,090
is going to be like I said fairly
simplistic

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,090
so if you've already done and your JS

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,120
on Python I could probably not learn
anything

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,539
and if you look at a person who never
wants to write a line of

16
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:57,070
a javascript and your life your also
probably in the wrong place

17
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,489
I'm cell I

18
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:03,789
aisles or warn you

19
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:08,049
just briefly I'm not a pro at this my
only experience is

20
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:12,500
having done in production for about a
year so we learn things the hard way and

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
this is kinda what I want to share with
you today

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,560
so at thirty seconds on angular and

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,140
what is this thing in case you don't
know I much about it yet

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,159
so it's a javascript Mb

25
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,030
star framework om it's a little bit like
any old MVC framework you now except

26
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,409
and a little different also I'm

27
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:39,610
it's it's basically for

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,570
you know if you got a lotta stuff going
on in the front end of your application

29
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,420
I you don't wanna hook it all up with J
cleary and

30
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,579
spaghetti code dealing with on that on
angular or

31
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,899
really any of the other front and
frameworks I amber and backbone

32
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,810
are gonna be your best friend there om I
like angular

33
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,630
I it's interesting I am it actually

34
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,789
as fired according to Google Trends
which as we all know is a very

35
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,980
reliable source India overtook backbone

36
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,580
are quite some time ago higher a year
and a half ago I believe

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,370
I'm which was surprising to me cuz I
always heard a backbone as Canada

38
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,459
granddaddy of them all

39
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,760
on so anyway what is angular

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,780
I its claim to fame what makes a really
special I think

41
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,390
is it extends the H&R Block have you
learnt us what that means is

42
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,510
you know you're writing HTML by

43
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,280
you get all these extra things the you
can play with and declared early write a

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,050
bunch of HTML stuff

45
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,930
that angular then I turns into this
beautiful functioning

46
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,660
ap om through the magic up to a data
binding

47
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,010
are so you know you change in value over
here and I automatically update original

48
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,599
the match

49
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,000
on this is all really cool I really fun
to see you

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,819
really good too play with I but we're
not gonna do that here because

51
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,310
is a spike on and if you wanna go to
JavaScript kono whatever they call their

52
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,709
thing

53
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,019
on you can do that on your own time

54
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,769
I'm like I said it's getting kinda
popular

55
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,780
I'm and I do highly recommended there
still some rough edges it's still a

56
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,879
fairly young

57
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,209
I have framework but its

58
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,900
it's really good at what it does on an
NBL fair's fair

59
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,560
so if you've never heard a python before
I am

60
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,970
it's pretty great um it also has a
number I love

61
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,799
MVC ish or MB star frameworks I am

62
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,209
and at least one of them is actually
pretty good

63
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,950
I am not here's tony fights but at work
we use Django

64
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,450
and so I love the examples I menus are
all from

65
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,269
Django I but the concept should be
fairly easily translated

66
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,950
comment if you want to yell at me about
came in flask at the end you're welcome

67
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,450
to do that

68
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:08,330
I'm yeah so the point is all these
things are kinda MB star frameworks

69
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,670
on angular Jaz on the front and and then

70
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,489
Django or pyramid of Lascaux whatever
you're doing on the back and

71
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,030
cell step by step what are we gonna do

72
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,060
first off we need to I have our Python
back and

73
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,979
serve up angular now for starters

74
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:32,370
and that's just a base HTML page no big
deal

75
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,820
its normal HTML like before

76
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,100
JavaScript even existed on

77
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,370
and usually all service on on the

78
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,370
the root URL depending on how you wanna
set it up but if painkillers going to be

79
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,449
you're kinda end all be all application
I'm you're actually gonna wanna set it

80
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:51,370
up so they're

81
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,639
all the URL's om all serve angular an
annular handles all of your routing

82
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,850
I'm so what does that look like on

83
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,400
this is a very basic angular ap about as
basic as you could possibly make one

84
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,310
and I made a little bit a hand waving
around angular again this is I con-

85
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,330
not not JS whatever on so there is some
cool stuff to be done

86
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,560
had to be talked about in angular world
and we're not gonna touch on

87
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,139
om but happy talk about after World Cup
on the inside

88
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,720
I'm so what are we doing here first of

89
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,169
I'm we're loading up angular right so

90
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:33,669
we've got that angular I library there
and then your application code which

91
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,789
again we're not really gonna go into

92
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,610
I'm you've got to tell angular way here

93
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,479
happy is with this Angie ap command

94
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,139
I instantiate a controller and then
here's the magic that we talked about

95
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,030
with the two-way data binding

96
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,669
arms you can see this looks more or less
just like a regular HTML

97
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,690
on but it's got some special attributes
and somewhere curly races and stuff

98
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,120
on so the energy model attributes is
what sets up that two-way data binding

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,380
on the double curly braces are

100
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,819
where you're putting that into your
template and so you know

101
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,940
the the really called mr. that you can
go see on a dealer's home pages

102
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,990
you type into the implant ants
automatically updates in

103
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,169
in that that paragraph to there and

104
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:24,259
it's magic and it's wonderful I'm

105
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,490
so then all that's left is nothing
really special or unique your you wired

106
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,530
up in your

107
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,660
URL patterns again as a jailer

108
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,660
Django bed you know you don't want to

109
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,819
have it serve essentially all URL's

110
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,430
and then allow that angular ap

111
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,509
to manage all the URL routing which it
does

112
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,139
kind of on its own

113
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,669
so what else do we need to serve up what
else do we need to lap

114
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:57,430
at template partials and this is what
angular does so that you don't have to

115
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,300
send

116
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,220
your entire monolithic crazy ap all down

117
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,380
to abhor browser all in one go

118
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,590
on it has what are called template
partials missus

119
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,389
and what it sounds like it's little
pieces a template the you can load into

120
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,210
and the angular ap as you're going from
page to page and it needs that but have

121
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,270
tempered

122
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,210
on but you need to serve these up now if
you can get away with it it's perfectly

123
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,199
fine to just serve those up as static
files

124
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,720
on that works well it's super easy and
there are going to be cases are least I

125
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,949
found cases

126
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,030
where you need sort of a two-phase and

127
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,690
rendering where you need Django or your
back-end server to render some things in

128
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,099
the template

129
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:45,090
om you know maybe a special I D you're a
token or

130
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,349
or something and then yuan angular to
get that damn plan

131
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:53,289
after its been rendered on the server
side are meant to do that is a little

132
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:55,690
bit more work

133
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,550
am so here's what we've got you need at
another URL

134
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,430
just byron up to serve more static I had
to render out some templates nothing

135
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,599
special

136
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,280
I'm and then the machinery to actually
render the template

137
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,970
I'm see you can construct a template
name for example

138
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,560
on do your special specialness make
whatever craziness you need to make in

139
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,509
your app

140
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:22,840
om and then render the output arm and
then you've got these template partial

141
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,699
that you can load up

142
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,940
everywhere in your anger lap

143
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,949
what else do we need to do I'm so we
need to

144
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:34,060
communicate with our server and this is
really the meet up what we're doing

145
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,719
right

146
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,950
on all the data changes all the data
that we're pulling into the app

147
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,130
on we need to communicate with the
back-end server om

148
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,709
and the best way to do this is a RESTful
API

149
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:51,570
on and it's a big enough deal that it
gets its own section

150
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,940
so step 2 I'm you're gonna build an
application API

151
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,760
on and i actually on like to think that
this as opposed to a developer API

152
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,990
I made these Terms up but they're useful
to me I'm an application API

153
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,570
is one where your application is the
primary user and developer API is one

154
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,170
where

155
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,040
you one other developers to build things
that Internet interact with your

156
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,399
code in with your data om obviously

157
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,620
you could have one API list serves both
of those functions that's totally

158
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,450
possible totally doable in some cases

159
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,080
probably a good idea I'm but there are
enough separate concerns that I like to

160
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,740
think about them separately

161
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,860
on and what we're talking about for our
purposes today is definitely the

162
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,339
application API

163
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:41,180
almonds will talk about some the special
considerations there

164
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,990
com the first of so we need to build a
clean

165
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,330
restful chase on API I'm

166
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,959
depending on your free market choice and
their loss a tool to help you do this

167
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,360
I in Django the jingle dress Primark is
pretty solid

168
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,700
om cornice and flask a restful there's
there's tools for whatever

169
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,750
and whatever your building om and mostly
they're pretty good

170
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,880
although and I think honestly

171
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,899
for and for application API's they could
use a little bit more

172
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,940
functionality there a little bit weak in
certain areas in

173
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,560
and I can talk about that and I
hopefully

174
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,440
we can contributes to new features back
to them at some point

175
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,480
arm and then on the JavaScript side II

176
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,490
you've got at all call rest angular
which also I feel I could use a little

177
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,550
work but

178
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,700
is still helpful and that helps you
integrate

179
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,149
with om a REST API on your back and

180
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:44,360
om and so let's take a look at this

181
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,630
if all you want is a simple clean API

182
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,959
this is all you have to do

183
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,630
I'm sea star by subclassing model you
set which is this thing in NJ no arrests

184
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,980
framework

185
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,570
and tell which model do and its

186
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:06,959
that's it on then you have to hook it up
into your URL routing

187
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,110
which is also fairly straightforward you

188
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,980
generate the routes for free with the
pew said

189
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,140
tell them which matter to get into and

190
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,350
looking up into your URL's om

191
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,940
and this works great in cases where all
you want to do

192
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,980
is the bare minimum simplest simplest
thing

193
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,260
I am and the world will be a beautiful
place if that was all you ever had to do

194
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,589
but unfortunately am there's other stuff

195
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:41,430
I'm so inevitably their issues were gone
and we're gonna head

196
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,120
where I kinda the standard clean RESTful
API

197
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,519
doesn't really cut it for our purposes
on

198
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,370
so let's talk about those what is it
sort of clean API

199
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,329
look like I'm

200
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:02,829
cell and first of we need to do some
authentication

201
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:07,480
I'm and it's not the easiest thing to do
right off the bat

202
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,670
I am mostly these

203
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,339
paid on back ends are very well
accustomed to doing cookie based

204
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,800
authentication

205
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,240
om you know it's what you would get on
the login page

206
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,019
I without a neurologist standard login
it's the server

207
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:26,139
gives you a cookie makes you logged in

208
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:29,880
you're good to go I'm and that's what I
ended up using

209
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,760
with angular I'm but they're also
benefits to

210
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,260
I switching up and going to a token
based authentication approach

211
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,490
numbers work on Jason Webb tokens om

212
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,990
which have some benefits over

213
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,100
I over the cookie based approach and
across domains if you want an AP I dot

214
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,420
your side dot com om and their

215
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,300
day and every better with mobile devices
there are some reasons why am I want to

216
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,529
do that

217
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:00,790
on 1 I'm gonna show you here is how to
integrate with

218
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,570
that the cookie based authentication
perch

219
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,329
so om please don't look at this

220
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:14,459
um its gross its terrible and it makes
me pretty sad

221
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,060
I'm and this is just one small
acceptable we did

222
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,630
I'm to get authentication working I'm so
lucky through its

223
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,839
I'm the first thing you do is AJG arrest
by mark

224
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,079
allows you to create these kinda custom
post and points

225
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,570
arms you're posting to this login thing
which is

226
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,670
I hung of the tale love your

227
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:42,079
real RESTful API comments already we've
broken the restful thing going on here

228
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,820
I'm and then what we do is we actually
authenticate

229
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,310
I by and by hand ourselves the user

230
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:54,079
log the man I'm and they were handling
all the responses are self

231
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,720
on definitely in urging arrest by Mark
provides some other machinery here

232
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,199
that's really nice

233
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,959
om you now serializing and that kinda
stuff

234
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,320
I but it's still kinda gross to have to
do this every time

235
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,149
I'm and again you know this is just for
login

236
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:16,430
cuz you also wants presumably a way for
users to sign up in the first place

237
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,800
and you also presumably want them to be
a lockout

238
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,529
am and don't even get me started about
the whole password reset flow its

239
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,680
messy and gross I'm

240
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,750
by if you want users you can I have to
go through this tough

241
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,779
I'm so NeXT's and

242
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:38,070
so you are permissions now to I

243
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,250
you know if you're going to have users
you're probably going to want them to

244
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,620
only see their stuff

245
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,310
as opposed to everyone's stuff on

246
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,639
and you know if with the traditional
methods

247
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,139
and just processing everything on the
back end this is fairly well understood

248
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,060
stuff

249
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,519
on you're probably used to doing it I'm
when you're accessing everything through

250
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,410
the API

251
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,870
I am it's not a totally open API there a
lot you

252
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,490
a lot of things you have to do is here
on

253
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,699
you now it's not just is not just

254
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:13,589
you know 1 person being able to see only
their things

255
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:18,000
it's a much more nuanced kinda ecosystem
up stuff than that right because

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,269
you guy some things that you want
everyone to just be able to see

257
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,510
ride like you know the tags that are
available on your website or

258
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,100
the stuff that shows up on your About Us
page you know whatever else you loading

259
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,459
in that everyone should have read access
to you but not write access

260
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:36,870
then there's row level permissions
there's the stuff that the user should

261
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,290
be able to see only if it's theirs

262
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,410
and then even beyond that the probably
supposed to be able to read their own

263
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,079
data

264
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,880
but you probably only I want them to be
able to write certain things

265
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,019
in that data and so this ecosystem so I
scare really really

266
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,279
complicated really fast i'm new show you
a little bit what we did

267
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,440
by honestly I think we need better
tooling around this

268
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,810
I like I said I think this is tied to

269
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,139
these and rest frame marks

270
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,160
being mostly built for the developer
version

271
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,339
on the API rather than application
version of the PI

272
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,600
I'm so I'd love to see a little bit
better tooling around these and if I

273
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,810
ever get to it

274
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,430
are happily work on that I'm so let's
take a look at what's

275
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,579
permissions looks like to see wireless
into

276
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:31,600
to the Django arrest by mark on a kinda
handles it this is what we did

277
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,630
you start off by subclassing their base
permissions

278
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,100
om and then we have this thing did
allows

279
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,899
you the keys to the kingdom if you are
an admin

280
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,490
I we've got this thing they if if he
said it up even a global

281
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,449
read and write permission and then if
you do this thing

282
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:54,600
you can have global repercussions only

283
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,190
om by again like I said this is only
half the story

284
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,019
because you also have to do

285
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,079
you know read verses write permission
you want them to bond to rate certain

286
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,780
things

287
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,370
arm and it turns out you you pretty much
have to do all of that by hand on p

288
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,600
you set definitions I'm so as a writing

289
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,860
a particular API endpoint om you need to
handle specifically

290
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,260
which people can access which things in
what ways

291
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,490
I'm sorts it ends up being quite that'll
work in that way and hard to keep clean

292
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,440
I'm yeah and then you want children to
which makes perfect sense of course you

293
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,110
do

294
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,350
I am so you want to be able to say

295
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,870
you know I want to see the users who
signed up in the last day

296
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,230
or I wanna see all these widgets that
were approved

297
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,340
on all these kind of filtering
mechanisms on those also don't come for

298
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,830
free

299
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,220
so you have to kind right those are self
I'm

300
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,400
how do we do that well so

301
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,610
you start by writing a filter set but
this other library called

302
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,730
chingo filters on the subclass the
filter said

303
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,100
I you creates the filter that you want

304
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,789
and this case we're doing less than or
equal to the created date:

305
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:14,370
I the name it was created relates the
underlying model which field on that

306
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,840
model do you want to filter by

307
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,740
and look up tape less than or equal to
and the input formats you specify

308
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,530
and then you tell it which model you're
talking about

309
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,660
I am and which fields you're allowed to
filter by

310
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,799
at this point you hook it up into your
view said

311
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,570
and it works but of course then you have
to do this again

312
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,630
if you want greater than or equal to

313
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,039
you have to do it again for every field
you wanna filter on

314
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,360
and the ISO virginity time filter
doesn't come for free either you have to

315
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,850
write that yourself

316
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,590
I'm so again I think there's a real
opportunity for better tooling around

317
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,030
this kinda stuff

318
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,450
om but at the moment it's it a little
bit amassed

319
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,870
you on sellers talk about a few

320
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,929
a outta left field kinda things that hit
me

321
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:09,080
is urs Sourav as signposts for you as
you go about implementing

322
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,740
I your angular JS I am back and on

323
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,140
firsts and it was this

324
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,169
when I'm calling mm TV star star which
is not a swear word

325
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:24,390
on this is I you know what happens when

326
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,370
your friend is in MB star saying and
your back and as an MP starting in you

327
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,669
want them to cooperate

328
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:36,610
show you know where do you actually put
your code how do you organize things

329
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,549
what's the right way to do this

330
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:42,570
I'm so there's some %uh the kinda rules
of thumb that I found to be useful

331
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,340
um first off you know irregular your
models on the back end

332
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,070
he set those up the nice and clean and
then you mirror them

333
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,080
in your front on and so the front and
knows what's going on the back and

334
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,470
accesses it is a PI and ideally

335
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,510
I you got some magic glue between them
that syncs everything up

336
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,559
and depending on your use case

337
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,650
I the controller this this is kind of
standard NBC

338
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,559
at labeling so controller and view code

339
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,130
I in my experience tennis just kind of
be all in the front

340
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,510
I'm so I love the in an angular

341
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,380
in all the controllers all the templates
they handle most of the work

342
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,480
I'm very little other stuff actually
ends up I

343
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,640
in the back end now

344
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,120
the last thing the kind of stays in the
back end or at least in our experience

345
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,880
did

346
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,590
was a lot to this background processing
stuff so sending emails

347
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,799
and you now doing a lot of background
processing

348
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:49,799
I'm doing can assume some big
computational stuff so there's data that

349
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,830
she's ready to ask for for the front and

350
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,789
on these are things that you know we
still do on the back end and there's

351
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,890
quite a bit of work going on there

352
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,520
you know I was I i get a lot of people
who say you know I know you got you got

353
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,610
angular so

354
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,280
he basically just have an API now right
om and sis

355
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,080
in some ways that's true and in some
ways there's still a whole lot going on

356
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,960
in the back and

357
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm I wouldn't want it any other way cuz
I love writing Python

358
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,350
I'm see other still plenty of work being
done in Python it's just different work

359
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,650
I other fun stuff and interpolation this
was this was good

360
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:31,020
I'm so and the template interpolation
symbols those double curly raisers

361
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,350
I'm it seems everyone kinda wants to use
those

362
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,620
angular Django & gingerale by default

363
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,640
use these double curly braces I'm and so
if you want to do this double rendering

364
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,429
where

365
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,059
you know Django for example as rendering
the template sending it down angular

366
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,820
and an angular runs the template you can
see the problem

367
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,890
I'm but the good news is there's a
simple fix

368
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,250
I'm in angular you a dick and Fig

369
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:03,600
and this interpolates provider you can
choose our own start and symbols

370
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,669
I think the double square races on ice
ombres also came with their own problems

371
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:10,070
but that's another story

372
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,990
on and a couple other

373
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,570
and little things CSRF wiring

374
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,600
I can often get broken if you don't make
sure to kind of set it up correctly

375
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,669
om so you wanna make sure that that CSRF
token

376
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:31,789
I get sad on the on the client side if
you're only ever loading one full web

377
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:33,650
page on that first page load

378
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,929
if there are no forms their I often that
that

379
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:40,110
that token won't get set and then you
have access to it

380
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,340
I'm seem to make sure they get sent down
with that first page load

381
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,770
and then as you are i doing posts
through the API you need to iron

382
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,210
absolutes in the headers

383
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,530
I'm that was a there was a lot of fun

384
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,870
and then the last 11 then I ran into was
ac

385
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,980
API pagination I'm so

386
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,260
and when you're working on the back and
and you've got a bunch of data that

387
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,730
you're you're going through

388
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,980
and that's tends to just work fine I

389
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,200
but when you have an API yuan pagination
cuz you don't want to return all

390
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,049
three million records I but the flip
side a pagination is

391
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:21,740
its paginated and you need to deal with
that

392
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,429
I'm so if you have a page is expecting
more than 10 or more than a hundred on

393
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:27,909
this thing to come in

394
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:32,090
suddenly have to write all this coat
around pagination on

395
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,940
and it's not at least for me when it
first cropped up it was a non-obvious

396
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
sort of bug

397
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,159
om which was which was funded dealer who
gave you have no idea why those things

398
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,860
just work showing up any

399
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,870
on the page on

400
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,770
so step for enjoy angular project

401
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,010
on this you not like I said I think
there's

402
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,140
a lot of room for improvement on the
tooling

403
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:02,210
on it's still kinda the Wild West out
there alone on nearly as much as I was a

404
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,659
couple years ago

405
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm and so angered you all the to try
this out

406
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,919
angered you all to contribute back your
good tooling improvements

407
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,059
om yeah that's about it

408
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:17,740
I'm I would i'm jeff has as I said I
should give a quick

409
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,610
and and shout out to choose as a paid
for me to be here

410
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,640
and if you get free lunches at work I'm
makin

411
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,179
we can do them better cell talk to us

412
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:31,529
I'm but thanks so much for letting me
talk at you and

413
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:35,340
now you can yell at me

414
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:41,210
thanks

415
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,430
yeah so is there any questions there
makes

416
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,490
there and their height

417
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:53,160
up devoted to point out that up here may
not have the permission stuff built in

418
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,220
for anyone else looking at this tho

419
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,040
if you want to I don't have a pair made
dad they have their problem solved at

420
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,420
least

421
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,750
onto the other when they don't bite that
wannabes awesome

422
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,870
thank you very much yes on yeah we we
actually

423
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,070
we'd kinda made this transition we were

424
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,620
we started with the Django app that had
nothing to do with I with angular

425
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,890
and it was sort of a slow transition
over to angular which is an interesting

426
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,670
story on itself but

427
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:24,510
I we did not have the at the luxury of
kinda examining all the options that are

428
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,100
out there

429
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,460
but that's good to know a

430
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,470
at so I recently developed a personal

431
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,530
Python where that and I didn't using
killer but I use knock out which is

432
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,400
kinda similar

433
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,440
on and so some other gotchas that you
described they

434
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,690
really rang true my experience um one of
the things you mentioned

435
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,460
the concept of having back and models
that are mirrored

436
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,640
with a friend JavaScript implementation
that was prolly when the biggest

437
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,700
struggles for me and I

438
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,490
I sorta Senate meeting at for
performance reasons did you find any

439
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,390
given your experience with that or any
tipster best practices for

440
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,230
skating as and synchronization how I'm

441
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,600
yeah God I not a lot

442
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,920
now it's a little bit painful it a
little bit case by case from what i've

443
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,540
seen

444
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,380
I'm so you know some other the models
that I'm dealing with

445
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,450
on it's fairly straightforward I

446
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,730
when you would need to sync that that
data backup to the server

447
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,120
om what I've wanted to do II

448
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,540
believe backbone actually has some
mechanisms for this

449
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,990
or so I've heard on by kinda doing dirty
tracking

450
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:38,190
on the fields in your angular side
representation on the model

451
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:44,940
on so that you then no what to send back
into Patrick West arm and ideally when

452
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,700
on by honestly now I have done a lot of
good solutions flat

453
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:55,280
if you come up with any should let me
know thanks sold my experience was a

454
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,990
little different

455
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,400
I was ready with flask instead of Django
and I wound up where was pretty much

456
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,780
just

457
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,410
an API from a nap by was their reason
you chose to

458
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:09,360
redefine the interpolation I characters
and said abusing gingers

459
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,470
raw tag %uh

460
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,240
be let me think so

461
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,530
gingers raw tag would allow you to just
kind of

462
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,950
not have ginger not process this portion
of the temple is that right

463
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,230
right on not particularly I didn't want
to have to

464
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,580
think or worry about it the riot act was
just a little bit more

465
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,960
effort every time you wanted to write it
there's no I think both are part

466
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,500
perfectly good solutions

467
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:43,500
is the reason why he chose his jiang
arrest three Maya content like tasty pie

468
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:51,200
did you evaluate several different API
packages in like itself could you expand

469
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,070
on that

470
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:57,180
yeah I'm I did do some research

471
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,820
up front I'm I don't have a whole lot of
experience directly using the others

472
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,580
on I'm sure other people here have
better answers than me on this

473
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,700
I waz I was jingle dress Primark was a
pretty robust set

474
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,570
a functionality I and I think that
proved out it really is

475
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:20,340
on the other ones some American have no
longer very well maintained and some

476
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,350
other time seemed

477
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,190
I top for a little bit less
functionality arms this one just seemed

478
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,170
the most robust

479
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,050
at the time we were making that choice
om I think the

480
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:34,330
the design patterns in generous for my
karma honestly a little bit strange to

481
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:34,810
me

482
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:38,730
on given kinda the way I know and love

483
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,030
Python arm it's very much have the mic
since

484
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,580
idea which I and others

485
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,030
a lot of and opinions there my name is

486
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,190
bed 810 see it really confusing really
quickly and

487
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,980
and at not being all that helpful so I
don't love the design patterns but

488
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,050
overall to pay robust re helpful

489
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,510
at all use it again CDs it again

490
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:09,510
hi yes I am back

491
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,200
question a so do you have any insights
into

492
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,060
I am in effective ways to test the
state's integrations when you're working

493
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,550
with

494
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,900
eitan Abson these JavaScript frameworks
on the front and

495
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,880
and canoe elaborate a little mark is
definitely you know

496
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,540
testing on the Python side which is you
know more or less what you

497
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,960
always done and then anglers fairly
robust its testing architecture so

498
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,920
eyes and integration point you're
talking about testing or or what's the

499
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,670
question exactly

500
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,240
I guess maybe in terms of functional
testing I mean read

501
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,340
have you guys done in at like anything
all the way through like so many amor

502
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,300
like any other approaches that you
