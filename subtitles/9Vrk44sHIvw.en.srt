1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,470
alright their last speaker in this
session

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,519
aged James Bennett he's gonna be talking
about the good parts for Django

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,519
hi

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,700
okay so I know you're all anxious to get
a lunch fortunately there aren't that

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,550
many good things in Django says won't
take very long

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,059
I'll but with quick introduction my name
is James Bennett

7
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,890
I am wanna be release managers for
Django used to work

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,170
at the Lawrence journal-world I which
the company Django originally came out

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:41,520
of

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,590
I've been involved with Django

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,140
for quite some hi not as long as Django
has existed though

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,620
are the initial public preview event
which I remember downloading and playing

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,660
weapon falling in love with I was in
July 2005

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,420
so we're looking at you know about nine
years

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,810
I love Django releases growing adding
code adding

16
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,079
features what is Django look like today

17
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:18,079
well we just did be 1.7 beta 160 01923
lines of Python

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,649
I was the count but I got outta that

19
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:25,389
Django is now you now

20
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:28,549
we will call it a full stack frame
workers we have

21
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,649
well a full stack all of these things

22
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:35,689
request and response and template hangin

23
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,499
or abdomen forms authentication and it
just keeps going and going and going to

24
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:41,539
have this huge

25
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:47,319
Lister features om Django can now be
literally described as the 800-pound

26
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,909
gorilla up the pipe on web framework
world

27
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,009
a title that I believe we've claim from
so

28
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,249
by growing enough bananas at them to
blow up the building Iran

29
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,689
cell this raises the question

30
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,139
aren't other frameworks smaller

31
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:07,490
or later or better or more flexible

32
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,819
in Django what is that the Django still
have

33
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:15,049
still dollars that makes it a good
choice so wanna talk about

34
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,140
three thanks mainly the

35
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,060
good parts of Django first 1i want to
talk about is gonna be

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,299
HTTP abstractions majengo provide

37
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:29,799
and the way Django handles the GDP and
your request response cycle

38
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:34,230
second is the conservative and yes I do
mean that word

39
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,280
conservative approach to adding features

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,849
third and finally our secret weapon

41
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:45,469
you know amongst our weapons are
surprises phiri fanatical devotion to

42
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:45,939
the pope

43
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:50,060
and the django application to something
we'll talk about it a few minutes

44
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,030
the first let's talk about HTTP HTTP

45
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,780
sucks when I love for that

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,209
okay AG DB has some problems

47
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:07,840
as in nineteen different request methods
god only knows how you keep track of all

48
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,200
of them and what options go

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,340
with them it is completely and
hilariously unaware that

50
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,560
unico it exists om persistence and often
streaming and security

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,719
and all these other things that we care
about here in 2014 work I know

52
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,909
either never added were attacked on

53
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,939
all maybe we should do that ten years
later

54
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:35,890
the chief be really kinda sucks is a
protocol to work with and traditionally

55
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,980
if you wanted to rate programs that
spoke HTTP

56
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,849
you wrote CGI CGI

57
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,810
is also not a lot of fun of here's

58
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,189
in phiri in phiri if you were to really
CGI tutorial this is what i would tell

59
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:53,569
you

60
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:57,700
would tell you that you're going to
write a script the web server is going

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,099
to set up all her quest information
environment variables

62
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:06,510
and then invoke your script your script
is also going to receive any submitted

63
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,099
data from the request over a standard
input your script will be in

64
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,590
read the environment figure out what's
going on read the standard input figure

65
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,459
out what's going on

66
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,180
do its processing and then on standard
output

67
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,990
send out your response headers and your
response body who here believes that

68
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,060
this is how CGI

69
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,060
actually works in the real world

70
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,050
notice not allow to happen that's a good
thing here's a CGI actually works

71
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,810
first of all you hope and pray that the
web server will actually invoke your

72
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,110
script it may or may not

73
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,540
at some point you're going to type a
command looks like this

74
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,600
you're not going to understand why

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,000
and if you don't get why you're doing
that ask someone who has a very very

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,690
large

77
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,740
beard to explain what that means

78
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,590
the environment you're going to be had
by your web server is full of a lives

79
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,330
and sadness and things that are going to
make you

80
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,840
upset at some point you're finally just
going to give

81
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,020
up on trying to figure out what you were
always requested because that

82
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,120
information could be in any have
multiple different environment variables

83
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,370
and you're just going to try to four mom
server after which she will finally

84
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,540
completely give up and start drinking
this is how

85
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:26,210
real programmers really do CGI I have
done this for a living

86
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,460
now fortunately in pipe on we don't have
to rate CGI

87
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,440
we write is key unfortunately whiskey is
basically CGI done

88
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,590
hi

89
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,710
I realize now some people may not like
you're in whiskey criticized

90
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,040
having a standard is important whiskey
is our standard gateway interface

91
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,050
but number one

92
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,930
it is the CGI style programming model
your hand in an environment

93
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,520
you are expected to parse and understand
what is in that environment

94
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,890
rather than behan handed any kind
normalize data

95
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,100
which means that your entire whiskey
stackhouse do parse that environment

96
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,170
okay now we pass it this component which
has to reporter said

97
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,780
with past data backup on Chester
reporter said and you listen up with

98
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,960
this massive parsing an environment
there

99
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,450
really was never that good have a
programming model pic

100
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,850
second whiskey doesn't really have any
way for different components to

101
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,500
communicate with each other in a
standardized way

102
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,460
you have to go and either invent your
own things that you stick in the

103
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,310
environment and hope something else
doesn't trample on them

104
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,550
or you have to go invent an out-of-band
signaling process

105
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,780
the way you return HEB responses from
whiskey sucks

106
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,570
as far as I know even people who really
love with you agree with me on this

107
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:51,050
and finally it inherits a cheap VPS
willful blindness to the fact that

108
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,650
character set other than Latin

109
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,880
one might exist somewhere arm

110
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,530
this is the real problem you'll run into
you the spec on whiskey actually

111
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,660
I don't remember exactly but it does on
pipe on three on pipe on

112
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,000
who you are required to return a byte
string

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,270
containing only com ISO 8859

114
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,390
dash 1 code points for a lot of things
and be

115
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,700
whiskey rat model actually checks you
passed exactly

116
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,570
the type stir not any subclass or
functionality

117
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,790
added to it cell

118
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,050
can we do better s yes we can

119
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,970
we can do much better so let's get
better let's start with HTTP request

120
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,690
let's have a class called HTTP request
let's have it already parson normalize

121
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,240
everything for you

122
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,990
let's have a have all the things you
wanted access now available as

123
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,080
attributes with dictionaries for things
like the queer history

124
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,060
for the post data but actually handle
character encoding any sane and

125
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,420
consistent way

126
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,360
so a programmer doesn't have to worry
about that when they're right your

127
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,490
application code

128
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,790
now we've got a request to a response

129
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,990
let's make each EP responses really easy
to construct and play with

130
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,960
let's not fool around with any of this
you know start response and send your

131
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,830
headers

132
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,990
and then do this and then do this let's
just happen each EP response let's have

133
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,320
subclasses

134
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,180
up the HTTP response were you know
common things like not being able to

135
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,090
find something

136
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,830
or needing issue a redirect then finally

137
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,460
let's tie it all together let's say okay
just try to call a ball that takes one

138
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,060
of these requests

139
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,060
ever turns respond to raises an
exception

140
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,469
let's do your all parsing the simplest
possible way let's just break some

141
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,090
regular expressions and say

142
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,450
this regular expression goes to this
call and you know if you ever need extra

143
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,630
arguments in there

144
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,390
okay with puts in capturing group in the
regular expression

145
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,750
and you know what that's it that HTTP in
Django

146
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,980
that all you have to do you have the
same normalize the PRI's abstractions

147
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,360
give this easy way has hopefully
everybody already knows regular

148
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,430
expressions right

149
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,750
you're all regular expression masters I
know you are

150
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,930
everybody does regular expressions easy
enough to wear

151
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,230
the Orioles and Billy Mays voices Justin
or in here

152
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,180
all but wait there's more

153
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,880
we also get Hepp and request/response
life cycle

154
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,430
we get a middleware system a credit all
middleware system sock

155
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,910
including jack goes including with
middleware including every middleware

156
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,440
system ever invented

157
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,750
they all suck be have to happen we have
we have signals

158
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,650
we have a way four components within
Django to signal each other and listened

159
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,440
to those signals

160
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,820
completely naturally completely back
into the frame or

161
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,610
we have the ability because everything
is just a callable to decorators

162
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,880
for composition you can stick

163
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,440
basically anything you can think of pre
or post processing

164
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,500
on any one of these callable just as a
decorator

165
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,590
because it is just call ables all the
way down turtles all the way down to

166
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,890
believe Simon Wilson liked

167
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,510
said from grow finally we do in fact

168
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,680
do whiskey yes we read Pepe 333 so you
didn't have to

169
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,400
because 20 views all these useful
abstractions you have a Django project

170
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,580
which is a whiskey application

171
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,250
and Django under the hood will do the
hard work of translating whiskey

172
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:32,310
to actually seen Hepp extractions for
you

173
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,250
personally borrowing a phrase from jean
is Wenski where he once said first of

174
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,380
job it doesn't have free

175
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,460
after that everything is gravy I'm
willing to take quite a hit in terms of

176
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,390
importing libraries to get seen

177
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,529
HTTP abstractions maybe this is because
they've been doing it

178
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:56,480
long enough bit I'd want to bang my head
against the keyboard sometimes

179
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,760
but to me that's worth a lot Django has

180
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,020
for my money and I've worked a lot of
remarks absolutely the best

181
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,680
each EP be abstraction and
request/response life cycle handling

182
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,110
on any of the current generation pipe
remarks it is

183
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,290
absolutely one of the best things about
Draco and

184
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:20,980
I probably still music even if I work
using any of the other components

185
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,000
second thing I wanna talk about is
conservatism

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,700
Django is a conservative framework

187
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,970
and I really do mean mass I really you
now

188
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,190
I'm not gonna call Django minimal I
don't think anybody would ever do that

189
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,670
Django is not a minimal framework Django
is a conservative

190
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,529
framework so take an example we have the
sculptor

191
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:49,120
that was new and 1.4 that

192
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,050
all it does is taking a string and
truncated at a certain number of

193
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,680
characters

194
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,950
hom you're familiar with jane goes
development process

195
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,970
you know that getting that and took four
years

196
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm not even joke coming soon in Django
1.7

197
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,510
back and regardless just you're talking
about we have a migration API

198
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,640
built into the core framework

199
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,660
that only took about six years

200
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,180
Django is incredibly conservative

201
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,470
about adding you thanks things get into
Django

202
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,060
fairy fairy slowly

203
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,330
in fact now some things are getting out

204
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,890
I if you look at the last few releases
and you look at road maps and plans

205
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,110
we r either have removed or are in the
process of removing

206
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,089
quite a lot of things especially in trip
probably more of them are going to go

207
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,810
we used to have the comments framework
which is still in Django but I don't

208
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,880
think is anywhere officially documented

209
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,210
are used to be data burrell's
application which now is just gone

210
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,020
the local flavor application which has
now been split out into it

211
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,950
on completely separate package I'll the
markup application which no longer

212
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,710
exists

213
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,430
probably a lot more things are going to
come how to Django in the near future

214
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,720
what this means is the jan was reached a
point where things are difficult to

215
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,240
added

216
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,930
easy to remove and not just whole
library 3p eyes

217
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,230
you look at the deprecation warnings
that check issues

218
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,410
are from one released in the next thing
sir deprecated

219
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,700
we go 1 release to release then it's
gone

220
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,850
we are not shy about that you have a
compatibility policy we do deprecate

221
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,339
things slowly but we get them

222
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:41,170
out thank usually this is described as a
bad thing

223
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,410
a lot of people over the years have
talked about how frustrated day

224
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,550
are when they're trying to contribute to
check may have an idea for a great new

225
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,470
feature

226
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,089
and it just sorta seems like it stops it
seems like it takes forever

227
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,080
to get this there are poorer warrant on
with the truncate filter

228
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,190
literally did spend four years
championing

229
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,710
arm on every mailing list he could find
in every penny

230
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,160
at five and finally it did make it

231
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,120
but generally people treat this as a bad
thing

232
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,460
I don't think it's necessarily about
paying project

233
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,170
be as conservative as it is back I think
it can be a good

234
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,600
oMG conservatism as an approach to

235
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,370
framework Desai is a strong preference

236
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,410
for letting solutions bubble up out
community

237
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,700
and in fact Andrews talk about
migrations is a great example of that

238
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,990
we have had over jaggers history several
competing

239
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,870
migration remarks self is the one that
seems to have

240
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,130
one man captured hearts and minds object
users

241
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,190
we just pick something way back
beginning were all her own

242
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,300
we never would have gotten something is
good sup

243
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,580
I'll core framework these days

244
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,500
Obama for Jacob talk about this and I
think he's onto something

245
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,779
should be more about providing the
underlying API's

246
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:06,540
to like things rather providing fully be
features

247
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,880
obviously there are still some things
are gonna have to be will feature

248
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,680
there but mostly those providing API
support

249
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,720
an hours old this is you end up with
jiang is often criticizes make it hurts

250
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,370
what component you end up with things
that are more swappable than you

251
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,360
expected

252
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,440
arm at my day job at Mozilla

253
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,890
work on the muscle development at work
the

254
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,310
number of things in Django we don't use
or that we use

255
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,770
something else swapping and we don't use
the template system

256
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,589
ginger of swapping that it is really
easy and making Jack

257
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,820
use it result of this is often you get

258
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,640
slightly more swappable home you also
get more stability over

259
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,640
hi something that makes me at least feel
warm and fuzzy

260
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,450
is every once in a while see someone on
predator on a mailing list for hackers

261
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,959
or talking about how they try to check

262
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,410
way back today and they got busy doing
something else and now they've come back

263
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:04,720
to

264
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,130
they say wow I can see it's got all
these new features but it still feels

265
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,610
very much the same

266
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,920
premark I'll 45 years ago

267
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,209
Django is conceptually fairy Perrys

268
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,279
people op features go into Django

269
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,470
NOP when there's hype around them not
when there's lots of people saying

270
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,620
we need to have this now features going
when they're ready muster the time

271
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,899
we help om

272
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:35,040
competition often ends up giving us
better solutions

273
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,500
cell again as a wonderful example of
that we've also had another feature

274
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,130
re had competing proposals and we've had
things even sometimes that never made it

275
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:44,950
in

276
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,860
because we never could get a solid
competing proposal

277
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,220
I'll the very first year

278
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,050
that we did summer code officially I was
mentoring

279
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,540
Thomas now mentoring

280
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,149
are talking about packaging and making
Django more friendly to packaging

281
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:08,999
thanks to tools and he put in a to work

282
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:13,659
and it just never really played out
nothing satisfactory ever came out at

283
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,549
the community as far as making Jack

284
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,629
play nice setup tools ads we never
turned into

285
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:23,360
all and set up to this spring sometimes

286
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,689
that's the result of having this type of
competition is realizes

287
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:29,789
shopping way makes what makes the cut

288
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:33,409
so nothing goes into the framework just
kept

289
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:36,980
so Django overall

290
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,119
feel free to disagree I think Django's
conservatism

291
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,360
towards new features and conservatism
word at

292
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,029
toward making major radical changes he
is really one of its tracks

293
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:53,440
primarily for that reason of that person
who comes in

294
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,820
hackers read it or on the mailing list
with that person who learned Django

295
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,299
once upon a time had now they don't need
to

296
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:06,460
all over again draco is op a completely
new framework every year

297
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,440
we get features every year begin things
that we can do every year

298
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,889
but Django itself remained remarkably
stable and consistent conceptually

299
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:19,710
speaking of conceptually

300
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,669
the third and final good part this is my
personal favorite

301
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,950
I've given several talks on this is
encapsulation

302
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,389
applications or PB upon

303
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:36,139
in caps nation as Django secret weapon

304
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:39,759
I'll you look at other ways to do
applications

305
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,710
Django project as we mentioned is the
whiskey application

306
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,940
home what is a django application go

307
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,820
if you wanna talk about say cure risky
applications

308
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,470
for applications in a lot of other
frameworks are hung up

309
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,350
monoliths were black box a lot of cases

310
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,999
where you sort of feel a need to do
everything

311
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:06,690
him on application or everything in one
endpoint

312
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,049
and sort because of the nature whiskey
anybody who's

313
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,309
more thoroughbred exposing was key to
you all the way through

314
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,269
it's going to end up being a lot of
black box because it's harder for

315
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:17,720
whiskey

316
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,739
components communicate with each other
I'll

317
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:24,190
you don't have store up and down the
stack signaling

318
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,039
communication processes that you would
happen something else

319
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,830
see you end up signing either these
really huge things or these things that

320
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,570
order act like black boxes

321
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,580
or both %ah

322
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,119
whereas in django application could be

323
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,200
any of these things models use utility
co

324
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,960
middleware forms

325
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,570
but they're all the Django bits where
they're all the Django EPI

326
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,330
its how I mentioned for example you
don't have to use checkers template

327
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:55,960
system

328
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,169
but if you use jaggers API's floating
record template

329
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,519
it just works even if you're using
jaggers template system

330
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,019
a reason ginger if you're using
something else

331
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:09,269
Django give you a bunch of safe API's

332
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:13,139
rely upon being present a lot of safe
assumptions

333
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:17,100
you can make about things are going to
be present things you can use

334
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,590
and this makes integration lots of
different component

335
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,169
whole lot easier then integrating amala

336
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,649
for an agreed-upon black box

337
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:31,559
django application as a result are free
to be sorted

338
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,279
encapsulated pluggable functionality
first time ever talk about this was six

339
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,039
years ago

340
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,590
laptop a Chaka Khan California

341
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,539
at the time I thought this was the
selling point of Jack

342
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:49,129
I still think it is the ability to right
ankle application as

343
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:53,210
single reusable pluggable encapsulated

344
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,600
whatever you needed to do at the time I
example was generous tration jacket

345
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,419
profiles

346
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,529
some things that I put out there as
examples

347
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:05,710
I'll since then people have gone above
and beyond

348
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,499
in terms that are for philosophy

349
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:12,609
%uh Unix tools a django application

350
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:16,960
is just like textile one thing do it
well

351
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,399
cell now for example I have a personal
blog our personal blog has an installed

352
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:24,619
absolutist with 12 entries at

353
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:29,200
had my day job or work on ambien we have
an install the app's list with closer to

354
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,809
50 aP's

355
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,830
and about a dozen a those are ones that
either

356
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,690
rolled ourselves or specific Gambia the
rest of them

357
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,159
are either other mazzola tools were
things that were completely third-party

358
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,299
people there integrated you can do this
with Jacko

359
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:49,710
Django packages is a website that list

360
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,820
well packages you can get for Django
criminalist

361
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,129
2,206 available aP's

362
00:21:56,129 --> 00:22:00,009
are as much as it's a cliche you can say
with Jack

363
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:04,129
there's an app for that I'll

364
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:07,330
aP's you we are at the secret weapon

365
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,779
in my opinion the fact that you can take

366
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:15,220
user registration or user profiles

367
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,220
for signing up with persona or

368
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,509
wiki or eighties

369
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:26,139
pick something else of India a studio
for showing Devils a web technology

370
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:30,350
you can wrap any of these things up
these were one-sentence ideas

371
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,619
into an application you can just pull
off the internet

372
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,840
plug in your website you a little bit
integration work you don't have to worry

373
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,769
about well as this app using some
completely different framework

374
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:46,129
is this app using some completely
different perhaps a complete

375
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:50,299
formal ivory completely different
controller setup

376
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:54,600
the lovely thing about Django music as
much as people complain

377
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,100
about their before stack are

378
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,029
feeling locked in what you get in return

379
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,659
for accepting some basic components and
you don't have to accept all

380
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:09,649
for you get in return for accepting some
basic component is the ability to do

381
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:11,249
this to compose

382
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:15,389
large complex sites with lots of moving
parts

383
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:18,940
without having to rate all of the code
yourself without having to do tons and

384
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,759
tons and tons

385
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,739
integration so much I love every
production Jack

386
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:27,549
site I C now a days is off-the-shelf
components

387
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:30,590
they're taking advantage back you can
just go

388
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,759
whole a bunch of Jack laps of pie pie

389
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:39,239
of Jack packages of everyone index from
and say okay we get that functionality

390
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:39,649
from

391
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:42,649
map that functional everything that is

392
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:46,729
up for your site your core business
logic you need right

393
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:50,979
you can probably outsource to something
else and Candace Rae water to collapse

394
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,009
that encapsulate

395
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:55,409
what your site needs to do I really
think

396
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:58,970
always have fought this is Jack a secret
weapon

397
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,169
I'll encapsulation usability possibility

398
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:07,320
applications and concept

399
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,729
of the Czech application is being
something so radically different

400
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:15,009
from what all the other type of remarks
were doing which was mostly

401
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:18,889
application is with application

402
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:22,379
I'll that's about all I've got. I hear
people clapping

403
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,979
in the room next door which means I time
this just about right

404
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:29,940
%ah so we have side 10-15 minutes for
questions

405
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,470
if anybody wants I believe we have
microphones

406
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:40,470
just one yeah I have

407
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,710

00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,900
familiar with all Wikipedia you can be
like templates that dues for descriptive

431

are we have a service written in
JavaScript does that IOM

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,160
we also have a demo studio where people
can upload demonstrations a different

434
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,140
web technologies

435
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,740
that is entirely check things

440
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,590
at the framework to I'm sorry the Django
framework for like the admin

441
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,350
I have the jack Hannahan able to use a
little bit

442
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:07,350
but whenever possible treetop okay i
member now

443
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,260
okay I is really a plans operating the
orange juice milk is there was fifty

444
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,930
complains the RMB much slower than say
SQL

445
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,470
me up every couple years

446
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,780
somebody comes up with a proposal to
rate in API compatible wrap-around

447
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,960
sequel alchemy

448
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,810
project or am at every couple years the
person who comes up with that idea gives

449
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,210
up on

450
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,080
about six months later okay %ah if
somebody can actually

451
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,310
work I would certainly be interested %ah

452
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,720
but so far I don't think anybody's
really used convincing implementation

453
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,340
thank you I thanks very much to talk

454
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,250
I wonder if maybe this is an obvious or
you don't wanna get into it better

455
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:55,290
I wonder if I can get you to do the
obvious thing and I and maybe compare

456
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,160
Django to some the other frameworks

457
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,580
and say we things on the strengths and
weaknesses in each direction not just in

458
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,400
in your opinion

459
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,840
and thinking a fam a flask Ando

460
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,100
web to pie I'll I like flask a lot

461
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,970
I'll I have had a chance to use it for
anything

462
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,580
major I really like a lot of the eight
years carrying down

463
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,610
disorder the essentials doing web and to
say

464
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,050
anything that's not the web go find
something else to do

465
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,740
words going to do WebFOCUS meticulously
on that

466
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,840
I really do you like that sort do one
thing and do it well

467
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,460
I'll don't really have experience with
bison don't really have anything

468
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,980
say one way or another are you should
check it out it's magic coca

469
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,080
I'll

470
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,190
what do you feel or other worst parts
Django needs work

471
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,630
are everything I didn't mention is a
good part in this talk

472
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:53,190
that is that okay %ah now Django

473
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,830
the internals are really messy and
really hard to understand

474
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,880
they tend to scare off contributors
medic classes

475
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,860
wave wave wave wave wave wave way too
many better classes

476
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,000
in Django I'll the or am

477
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,220
is a minefield hits

478
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,080
their Kb I think half a dozen people
world qualified actually make serious

479
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,600
changes

480
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,220
the RM at this point I'll honestly I

481
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,140
