1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,830
for twenty years I was a cattle rancher
in wyoming and if somebody told me that

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,569
I was gonna

3
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:08,630
by myself at this stage in my life doing
this they were found that little

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,679
improbable

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,030
but you know at that stage in my life
the idea that there could even be

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,210
this would have been more than a little
improbable

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,590
now I don't know it's fairly large group
people

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,480
and a have a hard time seeing faces 10

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,170
the later this bright on mine but to the
extent possible

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,750
at some point I wanna have something in
the way over

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,680
conversation with you even recognizing
it will be very asymmetrical

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,350
I know probably not a symmetrical the
conversation between Comcast and the

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,480
american people

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,260
his but bad anyway

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,579
and I am trying to to eliminate
broadcast media and I don't want to

16
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,559
become one so

17
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:56,649
I magnin I'm going to talk about a few
major principles

18
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:59,930
and in think that I think you're very
interesting but

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,470
the phenomena you represent and

20
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,600
and give you a little insight into you
know I I have to confess I am now an

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,380
elder

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,920
the internet I'm an old I'm in Internet
uncle

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,580
and for for somebody who spent most of
his time

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,210
a is life refusing to ever not be an
adolescent

25
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,520
the idea being elders is something a
drag

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,890
by it it turns out to be useful if you
can be a tad less in an elder at the

27
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,799
same time

28
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,170
BK his how you get the same desire to do
crazy shit but you

29
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:48,170
you know which greatly shit is likely to
fail better computer

30
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,900
for you and a that looks like fun but
let me tell you I remember

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,350
a no I

32
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,850
yet when I first came around

33
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,750
the thing that that I believe I'm you
know it was bill gibson's word but I'm

34
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,100
the guys are using it

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,660
sure what'd waited is when I first came
around cyberspace

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,850
I N in 1985

37
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,670
I it was very interesting to me

38
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,970
that there was already an identifiable

39
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,110
culture in this space that was not yet
space there was a

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,100
there was a I'm a flavor

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,530
that head and

42
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,370
it was just on the strength that think
with have culture

43
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,060
that I am got the idea that there might
one day be a

44
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,060
a new substrate for community to form

45
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,850
because I came from a small town in
Wyoming

46
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,080
and I could see that big the community
was based on

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,220
places like my small town in Wyoming
where

48
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,400
family agriculture was at the root of
the economics in

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,930
and there was a sense of shared
adversity and

50
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,850
real density in your relationship with
your neighbors in

51
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,310
and and necessity and I can see that all
those things were

52
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,510
being supplanted by television Landon
and

53
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,920
suburbia and large corporate working
environment where it was

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,280
it was considered to be good form to
make yourself out to be just like

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,579
everybody else is the corporation would
think that you were good interchangeable

56
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,709
machine part

57
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,239
I and the primary

58
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,070
impetus for privacy was so that the the
company that you wanted to work for

59
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,780
wouldn't be able to tell

60
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,299
that you like every other wanna the
masks that God wears

61
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:58,720
was weird as hell and everybody is by
the way I mean I

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,420
I use a marvelous you know he's very
ordinary people we talk about how the

63
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,780
crazy their friends word know the
friends are crazy

64
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,050
because because if you get down to an
actual examination people on the inside

65
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,290
and I their their unusual

66
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,280
and I mean I i'm I'm one of those people
who really insists on talking to you on

67
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,030
the airplane

68
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,450
and you hate does activity I know

69
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,470
I but I do it anyway

70
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,530
and mostly to prove to you that you're
more interesting than you think you are

71
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,190
and I'm which I almost always can

72
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:45,130
but I was worried about I was worried
about all those kinds of crashing

73
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,590
the aspect to

74
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,349
that way I can see my country falling
into your mind my culture or the world

75
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,740
for that matter with the generic aceon a
very thin

76
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,490
and I became and truly convinced that

77
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,770
that the answer this was to spread the
internet everywhere

78
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,159
and to you have the culture the

79
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:11,000
that shadow really

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,390
almost 2 a.m. say divinely given

81
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,979
inlex I and

82
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,450
and hearts that had been the original
uncles the Internet

83
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,789
have that become something grew embedded
in

84
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:28,890
in the cultures every space from there

85
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,890
very small point until it included
everybody which it inevitably would

86
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,240
and now we see everything as well I

87
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,740
and it I actually

88
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:48,419
it at first I thought it was going to be
a slam dunk but I mean I I thought that

89
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,159
you know the Age of Aquarius was gonna
be a slam dunk at a certain point to

90
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,820
now hype is already prepared for
disappointment

91
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,750
and but I really felt that there was
something that was so naturally

92
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,539
liberating about the Internet

93
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:08,759
and it was about connection it wasn't
about separation which broadcast media

94
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,090
on

95
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,590
I'm use the word it was about the
conversation it wasn't about that

96
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,790
it wasn't about the channel was about
content

97
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,360
which word only recently derived from
the containers my way

98
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,330
and I'm note that it's in code word for
word

99
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,960
where large corporation we own all human
expression we call it content

100
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,680
I am it was

101
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,370
it hadn't yet had the potential which I
still think in hand

102
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,630
giving a voice to everybody in spite of
the fact that in many cases will be a

103
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,509
terrible idea

104
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,650
and I have but led

105
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,509
you know I i also have faith in the
ability in

106
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,320
people third-degree a system where the
just because everybody

107
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,470
everybody has a voice says mean
everybody has to listen to it

108
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,130
you know so on the disc discriminating

109
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,370
digestive systems I think I thought then
and I still think

110
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,840
will devolve and I was pretty

111
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,430
I was pretty gung ho on this internet

112
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,750
and I and I thought that we were just
gonna actually slidin

113
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,660
invisibly into the gap that would be

114
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,060
that would be vacated by the nation
states as they realize that they had

115
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,110
nothing left

116
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,560
to do I after that after the cold war

117
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,360
and we'd gone to a global economy

118
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,419
and I'm I underestimated them

119
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,750
and I i underestimated the three
monotheistic world religions

120
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,720
who who naturally and I think correctly

121
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,600
regarded the Internet as the ultimate
harassing

122
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,319
because the internet is about authority
in

123
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,900
gathered by can sense is over large
horizontal plane

124
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,310
where authority is not only not
god-given it is

125
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,080
it is earned by a lot of other people
having exposes that a phenomenon to

126
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,759
their own

127
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,580
perceptions and judge them to be the
same views with those

128
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,220
this phenomenon may represent and they
need not be filtered through you

129
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:32,220
a a book or a document or something that
is absolutely positively right

130
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,650
this really plays hell with god-given
authority

131
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,729
which has been the system that we've
been operating under for quite a while

132
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,620
quite a while and when I say under I do
mean under United

133
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,150
great white column with gone on top in
you on the bottom

134
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,300
and mostly you know male figures in the
middle

135
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:58,050
and I'm and in three books that you had
to adhere to

136
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,329
and as as things are to come apart for
those

137
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:05,750
for those things they became much more
fears in there

138
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:11,640
in there demand that that their
constituents observe them

139
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,010
religiously shall we say and

140
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,089
and and moreover

141
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:21,810
I knew that the record business was was
the ugliest thing I've ever seen

142
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,920
but somehow I didn't think that it was
plays ugly as it turned out to be

143
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,709
I me what it turned out to be was ending
was so ugly that he would rather kill

144
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,060
itself

145
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:38,709
and everybody in it then do something
that was wise indecent

146
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:42,709
and and that's pretty much what it's
done

147
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,660
and I spent many years trying to explain
to them that that is actually not in

148
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,220
their best interest

149
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,060
to make expressions scares there's a
huge difference

150
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,640
between information economy and and on

151
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,949
Anna an economy have hard goods

152
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:07,209
in the sense that Adam Smith was
perfectly right about to

153
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:11,050
about scarcity in value right

154
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,350
it's completely different with
expression information

155
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,430
where familiarity has billion

156
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,940
scarcity not so much

157
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,320
I me if I've got the world's largest
diamond in my pocket

158
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,490
a as they're making a big 12 people
might be curious about

159
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,880
nobody will know that it's there and

160
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,050
or maybe not curious about I

161
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,519
met nobody will know that it's there and
on

162
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,810
and it will still be incredibly valuable
if I have the world's greatest song in

163
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,600
my head

164
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,779
it is useless valueless has no value
until I've started sharing with people

165
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,010
and then it gathers value fairly slowly

166
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,089
on the bases have how many people can
sing along

167
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:04,060
it's a very different thing and the band
that I wrote for discovered this

168
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,370
accidentally I mean we

169
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,480
we invented by remarking without really
meaning to

170
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,440
I like most other things which
effectually very

171
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,760
very improvisational organization

172
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,130
as LSD will do that to you and

173
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,880
doesn't give you a wide choice a

174
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,800
and we noticed that and that people were

175
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,820
we're taking our concerts and and

176
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,860
in the in the early days in you know the
record people Greg in folks at Warner

177
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,680
Bros

178
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,350
said we had to stop them because they
were stealing something from us and we

179
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,500
and we kinda went along with it around
and then we off and 11 are they feeling

180
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,190
I mean it's not like we're playing the
same show twice

181
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,880
so is a that people won't buy the
records the Phillies

182
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,050
10 seconds remaining and decide this is
not good for you to be mean to a

183
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,040
deadhead especially if you're the
Grateful Dead

184
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,100
because deadheads their hapless biatch

185
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,279
yeah it's just crew well

186
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,480
I couldn't do it and I think today so we
let people taper concerts not realizing

187
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,820
what was gonna happen with those tapes
were going to become this

188
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,839
unbelievably effective system

189
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,760
for spreading word about what we did

190
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,700
and and by the time we actually did
Dynomax

191
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,399
don't know we whether we died yet we
still seem to you know

192
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,839
cling to weird life but and

193
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,339
I would say that we were we were done
when jerry garcia was back in 95

194
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,120
but at that point we could fill any
stadium in in america and maybe the

195
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,070
world

196
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,620
without ever having had a hit record

197
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,829
based on the fact that all over tapes
had been big hits

198
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:01,339
and the fact we get all our audience
around with us

199
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,360
quite which yeah it's good if you can do
that

200
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,060
and but this brings me around you folks
anyway because

201
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,060
part of the reason we can holler
audience around with us

202
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,709
and partly the reason why that sharing

203
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:23,550
and sensitive to meet community was so
critical among the dead heads

204
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,180
is what intrigues me about you but I
think who's dis

205
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,180
I have because now there have been
cultures

206
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,500
associated with languages before I mean
I

207
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,500
not French is a good example do

208
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,310
I wrote here yesterday god bless you my
i

209
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,160
and movies in the eye inspector tire

210
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,839
Patrick Dale day and have I think it I'm

211
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,790
slaughtered your name correct when and I

212
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,870
who is French and

213
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:07,360
he was on both the hideous flight said I
was and we took great comfort in one

214
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,029
another

215
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:11,790
and I was talking about the French
Academy in French language in

216
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,140
and Python and how culture

217
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,519
and the language itself had a as
mutually defining

218
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,709
quality and where authority lay in that
system since

219
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,279
one of the things that occurred to me
when I'm when I first encountered the

220
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,250
end I

221
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,540
I turned my friend netscape or with whom
i started

222
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,470
the Electronic Frontier Foundation I
said at lasted two working anarchy

223
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,899
and he said well probably but

224
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:45,510
it's been my observation and rate every
working anarchy there's an old boy

225
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,250
network

226
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,170
and you know this case I think we may
have a

227
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,699
and young girl network it's coming
online to

228
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:59,370
thank you I and I that's not lip service
amina

229
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,490
for the reason I'm here is because that
there's actually

230
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,190
the you know very interesting thing
about you by fines

231
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,709
you you know there are a lot of music
despite the big phallic symbol for the

232
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:12,079
sack

233
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,140
further I

234
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,170
splendid anyway and I am

235
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,940
but butting he also alluded in fact that
there is usually a benevolent dictator

236
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,019
somewhere in there

237
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,800
and I believe you have when I I hope
he's here

238
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,720
being benevolent thank you

239
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,740
I and

240
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,970
and this you know I back in the
beginning a

241
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,380
for have computer languages

242
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,829
there actually were few things that had
a culture the UK to see with associated

243
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:52,779
with the language

244
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,399
on you see they were very small and
intense and

245
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,779
and often call like you know attack

246
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,170
TX people people would get

247
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,839
have crazy the realists

248
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,600
people that we going nuts and and I'm

249
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,569
and you know and then there was the
culture around seein' and Unix

250
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:18,920
their generally UNIX mean culture

251
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,459
where everybody look like Dennis Ritchie
but you know in those days ready to

252
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:26,079
everybody you anything to do with
computers

253
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,410
look like Dennis Ritchie anyway for I
but

254
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,730
you this is very different demeanor
Python

255
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,020
is you know high finance guy in stylish

256
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,880
and you know actually far more engaged
with

257
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,209
and with the party if the

258
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:50,660
over the whole then the UNIX weenies
every dream to be

259
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,000
you know why I went to a lot other

260
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,120
their gatherings and they felt they were
being pretty social if they were looking

261
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,250
in your shoes

262
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,519
I and

263
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,380
and this has a completely different
flavor and the and that's really

264
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,740
important because

265
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,579
because sent since I was wrong about how
the

266
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:16,839
governments in the industrial world
we're going to serve fold up their hand

267
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,780
and split

268
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,339
and since then come back with a gigantic

269
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,510
vengeance inner are absolutely convinced
that is their right

270
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,690
and do need to impose all the stuff they
had that didn't work in the physical

271
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,220
world

272
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,030
on the cyberspace given another really
nasty shot

273
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,130
especially game with the ability to
serve a leveraged body

274
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,809
on the planet in a way that they never
could have before

275
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:46,190
so you know I take a great deal

276
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,590
comfort in the fact that I have almost
daily conversations with aides snowden

277
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,929
that they can't stop

278
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:56,830
if they were elected they could pick you
make it so that we couldn't %ah go to

279
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,360
the bank

280
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,610
maybe they just wanna listen and because
it's more amusing what they're thinking

281
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:09,900
that burned and no I mean that they came
back

282
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,470
and they came back strong and and then
the problem is that

283
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,080
as things get taken over by things like

284
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,309
like Comcast which it certainly has no
bill rights and as things get taken over

285
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:28,190
by these new serve matter I

286
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,440
bodies love

287
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,270
international forum like the ITT

288
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,350
dreadful are defective and horror

289
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,620
I'm you

290
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,690
have not regulatory redress

291
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,520
what you have is cultural redress what
you have is

292
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,840
is something is much harder to wrap

293
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,340
opposition around but you know a lot of
things without having to say

294
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,140
you folks have a lot of unwritten codes
that are incredibly powerful in an

295
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,280
environment like this

296
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,480
and you are spreading the culture

297
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,809
openness and collaboration

298
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:17,390
and curiosity and human service

299
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:23,530
into the environment that will become
the foundations for the future

300
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,710
I mean I'd remove a day

301
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,809
and if is not a crazy dream

302
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:32,830
when everybody on this plan

303
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,960
who wants to know all that is presently
known about something

304
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,960
will be able to do so regardless and
where he or she is

305
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,440
and and I dream every day

306
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:01,440
where the right to know is understood to
be a natural human right

307
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:08,379
that extends to every being on the
planet who is governed by anything

308
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:11,440
the right to know what

309
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,440
its government is doing and how and why

310
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,730
and I rely almost entirely

311
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,960
on people like you who are building

312
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,680
the plumbing and who are you

313
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,860
really defying the politics I mean where
and one other things

314
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,130
in the beginning a BFF a

315
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,360
I

316
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,950
I was expressing dismay

317
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,960
that

318
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,980
he just suddenly dawned on me that

319
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,570
that for civil that the im the bill a
writes the United States Bill of Rights

320
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,180
was a setup local ordinances

321
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,330
that actually only apply

322
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,420
within the confines have

323
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,280
places where that government that had

324
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,460
supposedly advance those those notions

325
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,690
could enforce them by having at the same
time the ability to take them away

326
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,730
and that if you are moving into an
environment where they didn't have that

327
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,050
ability necessarily

328
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,350
you're also moving into an environment
where they didn't have the ability to

329
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,720
extend them either

330
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,160
that rates were not something that you
could count on any government

331
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,870
or body to extend

332
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:46,360
that rights had to be parted the
technical architecture

333
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:53,360
the the Internet

334
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:01,590
and you are the people and people like
you

335
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,620
that that you'll attract and your
numbers you are the people that will

336
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,630
define that technical architecture

337
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,500
and we'll make sure that that dream that
I think you share as well

338
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:21,500
will come to us and that we will end up
being extremely good ancestors after a

339
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:28,820
thank you

340
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,860
yeah we

341
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,960
when you're from music you like to be
able to do an encore not

342
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,960
ahead him now I would like to do some
Q&A

343
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,110
I ever get any be a long time right
who's the guy with the cards we got some

344
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,630
time

345
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:02,000
time is up 020 plenty of time actually
okay great now

346
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,120
I can't see sure what I'm gonna actually
at

347
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,930
depend upon is the guys with the Mikes
will

348
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,760
will take them to somebody that they
think might have something interesting

349
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,500
to say

350
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:20,500
I

351
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,720
thank you very much for your talk

352
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,100
on you talk to a bit about rights i was
just curious

353
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,220
how do you define a right well i've

354
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:39,220
I define a right as as the generally
recognized ability of somebody

355
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,530
to do something the

356
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,800
that some may wish they didn't do but
that they are

357
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,810
allowed to do because it is their right
I mean

358
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:55,810
and I'm you know when I think you have
the right to free speech

359
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,200
what I think I've is that you know

360
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,310
there is Sam's stonov a bitch

361
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,820
that I disagree with categorically

362
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,020
who has the most odious toxic stuff that
he says

363
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,930
and by god I I am I'm going to defend
that

364
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:22,280
mother fucker head that's what I think
about it he has a right to be

365
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,500
that person as long as he doesn't get so
toxic that he insisted I

366
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,320
share his views and that i right writers
like that a right-to-die

367
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,550
right is use

368
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:40,510
the ability to manifest yourself against
the powerful in a way that is generally

369
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,480
accorded

370
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,890
the a kinder sovereignty by

371
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:51,890
by those within your culture thanks

372
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,880
thanks for your top gun I just had a a
couple a

373
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,400
related questions one in the future we
read by the way they need me questions

374
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,020
you can

375
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,490
you can come at man united abner now
definitely

376
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,070
questions 'em what one just sort of
dealt with in this current

377
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,170
a row were shipping all over data to
clouds that are

378
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,680
controlled by few large big corporations
and

379
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,570
it in this future is is privacy

380
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,250
and part of our life liberty and pursuit
of happiness

381
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,120
if information is so freely available
that we can swerve

382
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,380
quickly look up anything about anything
and as the cloud

383
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,230
and storage and compute costs were is
where the race to the bottom seemingly

384
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,050
between

385
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:42,380
at the big providers on the the Longhorn
the tent has been connective idi

386
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,370
and now we see and initiatives like
internet go to work

387
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,780
emerging with Facebook trying to bring
collectivity

388
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,100
two places in the world it could have
probably never been before

389
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,260
answer curious how you think that may
play out is

390
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,250
the the future unfolds million

391
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,130
there's a lot done by more than that I
but

392
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,450
back like I say I came from a small town
wanna things

393
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,460
about coming from a small town is that
nobody has any privacy in a small town

394
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,520
me everybody's really famous small-town

395
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,960
and and so I grew up with that

396
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,380
without that sense that you know other
people to know everything that I was up

397
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,930
to but the thing was we had mutually
assured destruction capacity if somebody

398
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:34,760
wants his house I knew where their
bodies were buried do DeMint and then

399
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,230
it was best just not disturbing in

400
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,580
on either side and

401
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,170
the problem that I have at the moment is
that yes I I think

402
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:50,110
privacy is doomed and i actually think
that privacy is actually a little kinda

403
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,060
pathological

404
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,910
a mean that the the reasons that we want
privacy are not good reasons reasons we

405
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,980
want privacy here

406
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,980
because we fear the judgment have love

407
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,980
organizations that should not be
exercising judgment over those matters

408
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,890
as long as as long as we can as long as
we do our jobs and do them well I don't

409
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,470
you know if we go home in and also do
three bags and a cat that's our

410
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:26,730
thats argue I and

411
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,930
so but the problem is that we don't know
what judge miss those large institutions

412
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:32,660
are making

413
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,100
theirs is under a cemetery that is
getting worse

414
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:41,470
between the the loss and privacy and
party individual

415
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,520
and the rank No the maintenance of
secrecy on the party the institution

416
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,850
and this the secrecy part

417
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:53,080
were it partly to disguise their
complete incompetence I think you'll be

418
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,950
pleased to know that they're nothing
like his

419
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,500
scariest a they make himself seem and
they would be better advised to make

420
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,130
everybody

421
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,280
see how they are certain we wouldn't be
so afraid of them

422
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,840
but nevermind that I it is really
important

423
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,480
and it is important to everybody in your
YouTube you should find himself san

424
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,340
Leanna

425
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,600
in an ad snowden composition

426
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,850
I is very important to open up those
windows and let the light shine

427
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,020
in there and and make sure that secrecy
doesn't go on

428
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:32,380
units units uninterrupted state I and if
you if you know something

429
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,440
you think that others have a right to
know

430
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,450
and often is the case that you that you
do there's another organization I found

431
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:40,880
it with

432
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,980
with mine greenwald daniel ellsberg in
and more pointers in Jan

433
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,940
be sacked mention Jourdan very recently

434
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,980
did first did fun wiki leaks but also we
r

435
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,360
taking care of people like ed in anybody
else wants to come out of the woodwork

436
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,320
and so

437
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,240
if you are one of those folks if you
want to come out of the woodwork

438
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,630
we will we will protect you and see that
good things you have to say

439
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:15,630
get said no way that they can't stop

440
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,680
yeah

441
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,860
and I recommend your checking out the
freedom in the press the

442
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,300
foundation we gave it very innocuous
name I

443
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,030
because it we're also we're also
building open source tools

444
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:35,040
a for easy to use encryption

445
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,610
for journalists and whistleblowers and
we could probably

446
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,880
you like your help on that so check it
out

447
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,520
there's a so

448
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,720
Barlow is a guy who his arm build a
community that's right around

449
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,870
yeah corporate infrastructure with a
firm hand

450
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,540
what her advice you have for communities
like this

451
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,740
no have lessons learned from the stuff
you've been able to build both in music

452
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,890
and within this current space were

453
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:11,550
and the suggestions you have for this
community continue to grow itself can

454
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,340
prove itself

455
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:18,150
I resist ideology

456
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,390
I but but encourage believe

457
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,770
and it's a fine line but I mean

458
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:30,520
ideology selling it happens in your head
belief in something it happens in your

459
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,160
heart

460
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,910
and you know try to make sure that your

461
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:38,070
operating from somewhere south have your
head when you're when you

462
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,980
imposing opinions on people and try not
to impose billions and people who when

463
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,070
you can dreaded

464
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,390
figure out ways to get the consensus to
work so that

465
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:52,480
so the urine be rollin on this game
together and that's one beauty beautiful

466
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,780
things about an open source movement as
you can after beer this stuff doesn't

467
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,480
work

468
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,340
on IMEI really I think

469
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,860
my best advice would be that you go on
doing what you appear to be doing

470
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,550
I because I I know there's politics in
your

471
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,040
life among humans but

472
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,240
really that doesn't seem very political

473
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,530
by my standards that I've become
accustomed I think it's

474
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:29,110
I think you're doing the right stuff on

475
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,240
over here

476
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,690
you mentioned a minute ago

477
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,910
belts building open source tools for
helping journalists

478
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,960
a.m. with infected communication on

479
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,440
personally to me it seems like on better
access

480
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,660
too easy in cryptic communication for
everybody is a very positive direction

481
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,050
to go

482
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,650
on seems like you agree with that
sentiment what

483
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,060
technologies should how

484
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:02,110
can we do a better job that is there
somebody who's

485
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,490
his advancing that that we should be do
you think that we should be paying

486
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,000
attention to and

487
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,330
and how can everybody in this room

488
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,520
make help promote that well you know i i

489
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,280
I think the folks at you know that
generally are

490
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,640
in the in the senate or I

491
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,300
and its many manifestations are really
doing great work

492
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,520
and you know and our farming it out in
creating community

493
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,370
you know sir above the larger toward I

494
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,350
thats it's one area where i think is I
see

495
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:42,010
allies to level like confidence in do
you see that as something

496
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,310
that each did can and will move

497
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,570
too deep pervasive in all traffic that
everybody

498
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,560
II phases I think it's you know it's in
there Bradley everywhere now

499
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,750
you know there's a there an awful lot of

500
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,730
a to are packets on the Internet what's
up

501
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,940
and you know and I think they're all
kinds of things that we can do you

502
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,770
simply routinely make

503
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,350
things invisible or semi visible I mean

504
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,150
you know if F has is a ATP HTTPS

505
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:19,640
everywhere program you know you just put
a plug in on your browser in all your

506
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,630
your the communications are pretty are

507
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,900
been crafted Hurley's they were until
recently a

508
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,520
patton now I don't know I

509
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,120
with my head you know you're the people
who will figure out how to solve that

510
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,510
quickly I hope

511
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:42,130
the hell up

512
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,790
I agree with you when you say

513
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,850
government surveillance as bad and I
also agree with you when you save it

514
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:53,220
anybody should be able to find out
anything they want about anything

515
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,170
in order to do that I didn't quite say
that I mean I'm

516
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,740
I'm Synopsys Inc yeah your YouTube it as
my filter

517
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,000
okay on what you said so so my grip may
be flawed

518
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
on I

519
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,130
but yep get nevertheless both of them

520
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:16,110
require the same think the acquisition
correlation and dissemination of data

521
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,860
and

522
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,230
arguably the differences are how the
information is acquired

523
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,280
sometimes without consent or knowledge
and sometimes with

524
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,390
and the dissemination of data years

525
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:32,679
either controlled or free and open my
question

526
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,970
is how do you reconcile the fact that
they both have the same

527
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,130
needs and requirements

528
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,980
and ultimately goals other than

529
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:51,020
evil verses good well I don't know they
have the same goals

530
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:56,080
I mean and i sorry anyone im the
community that is being served

531
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,950
so anyone can find anything if they're
in the right community

532
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,380
government surveillance is the
government community and and the

533
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:08,270
security community Ryan the other side
is everybody well-accepted

534
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,330
you know that the reality is it doesn't
fall out quite like that i mean

535
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:16,690
the interesting thing is that is that
I've been consulting to the NSA and CIA

536
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,570
for twenty-some-odd years

537
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:23,530
on and you know that I have my
constituents in their

538
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,680
you really believe that the the
objective that the whole enterprise is

539
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,230
to figure out what the truth is

540
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,540
and tell it is in in as

541
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,130
on the influence and burnished ways
possible to the people who make

542
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:35,810
decisions

543
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,350
so they actually make the decisions on
the basis is knowledge rather than

544
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:45,410
then hysteria and both sides believe
themselves patriots

545
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,450
dade they they do because they are

546
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,770
agree you know on I've been recently
trying to get

547
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:58,420
the conversation going between couple

548
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,120
a friend to mind Mike Hayden in

549
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:07,310
in at Snowden guy this is so far been
steady work but I've

550
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,430
a I i think im

551
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,970
yet how I think it is possible if I can
if i cant

552
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,180
comp have a conversation with them in
like them both so much maybe I can bring

553
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,870
them around

554
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,580
to to sharing my opinion but I

555
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,900
you know you could just

556
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,340
and thing we gotta watch out for is not
just data acquisition data

557
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,250
you know actually the more data
something evil has the better off you

558
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,920
are

559
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,330
because it you know if if you're trying
to find information

560
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,630
you like in the needle in a haystack
analogy the first-order businesses not

561
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:48,690
to go out and exponential increase the
size the haystack

562
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,830
which one do is get a better magnet and
their magnets get worse

563
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,860
and and we're spared their despotism by
their incompetence

564
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,820
they they don't know the difference
between data and information and there's

565
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,710
a profound difference between eight and
information

566
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,700
information is something that a human
mind is found relevant

567
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,670
and making that transform is really
important important

568
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,720
answer really that that the thing that
you wanna

569
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,300
get down to you is is art what did they
find relevant why they think this is

570
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,960
important what makes this information as
opposed to something else

571
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,930
what do they intend to do with this
information once they have it

572
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,270
what are the empowered to do whether the
visibly impaired to do and not so

573
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,830
visibly powered

574
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,270
an those are the real questions it's not
whether or not they can get the

575
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,810
information because

576
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,880
at this point anybody even halfway
deadly

577
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,730
on it can take the digital slime trail
that you're laying down every move you

578
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,160
make

579
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,360
and roll it back up and know you well

580
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:02,360
that's not the issue its it's what you
do with mister

581
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:06,790
yes %uh first thank you for a
terrifically interesting time

582
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:10,160
and my question is you cited the roles
%uh

583
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,340
religion and governments as

584
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,430
the institutions that are sorta putting
had put the brakes on

585
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,900
the revolution have open this in
collaboration and they're coming back

586
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,070
with a vengeance

587
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:26,140
but I was wondering what you felt was
the roll up the corporation the

588
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,070
multinational corporation in particular

589
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,730
as well you said that you thought we
don't have any real

590
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,150
regulatory redress only cultural redress

591
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,710
and I would think that we do still have
regulatory

592
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,740
reject dress in the sense that it's the
roll up the

593
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:49,020
corporation and money in government
that's preventing our democracy from

594
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,930
being you now playing its regulatory
role on

595
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,290
I think perhaps the nation states really
have

596
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,670
mean their power away from their power
they no longer have much power but it's

597
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,700
the money now and the corporations that
are driving the government's

598
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,320
and as a late especially in the united
states for instance

599
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,010
you know the Supreme Court is enabling
corporations to completely

600
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:17,580
co-op our democracy but have you totally
given up the Hope Love

601
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:22,650
you know regulatory political redressing
rains on the corporations that way and

602
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,870
if so how do we combat that problem

603
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:29,240
well unified completely given to bed
hope I wouldn't have so many are BFF's

604
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,340
lawyers dredging up to

605
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:36,140
to do we re battle with those windmills
everyday

606
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,160
I but then

607
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,660
you know the the the problem is
everytime

608
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,730
every time you rest your face in
regulation you

609
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,320
you extend its life span in a way you
you give it

610
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,420
you give it credibility that it doesn't
deserve

611
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,440
I you know so people were we were
talking about getting net neutrality

612
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,760
from

613
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,590
from FCC rulings and I granted over a
short period time if that if the FCC had

614
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,550
done what

615
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,220
it's similar bodies were doing in europe
at the same time in terms in

616
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,180
recognizing the necessity for a
proliferation of the Internet

617
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,580
feeds we would be in the same shape
address in the world

618
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,580
industrial world is and having really
great

619
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,590
choice is an internet service in

620
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,520
you know and I'm being much more
advanced than we are in the United

621
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,000
States where

622
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,050
word you know the goal I make comcast is
about to set a standard

623
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:37,310
something that will really be outta you
know The Hobbit trilogy but

624
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:43,220
I anyways it it's a bad situation we
have here we could have made a better in

625
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,800
a certain critical point with

626
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,010
with I regulations and and obviously

627
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,660
getting the the public entities to

628
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,570
to rule on monopoly you know i mean
these guys these guys claim that they

629
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,020
rendered

630
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,690
they're interested in free markets where
you don't have a free market if you've

631
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,270
got a man are market that is dominated
by monopoly

632
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,890
that's not a free market I and

633
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,100
you know you have to turn their rhetoric
background I'm say well yeah I

634
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,650
were for free market let's break up you
got dem na please

635
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:22,650
now will have a free market

636
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:23,980
but

637
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:29,060
you gotta have government with faith an
power enough to do that and

638
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,320
you know the present through
yellow-bellied government league and

639
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,280
Washington

640
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,960
and do you think the Internet community
on the pipe on

641
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,620
or open source community has the power
itself to bypass government's control

642
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,710
over the corporation's I mean if the
corporations are themselves

643
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:52,920
you know a source up Reaper repression
and

644
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,450
you know holding up this revolution that
you seem to be

645
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:01,010
you're kidding how do we then without
the use of government

646
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:04,120
or in conjunction with it actually

647
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,320
battled the corporation you I think
they're I think you

648
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,230
you have the key word there by Best you
know be sneaky

649
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:15,770
and I mean they're going to get there
was a point in my generation where

650
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,410
people had

651
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,810
to had members occurs at resistance
already

652
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:23,580
and I said mine said get around
authority

653
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:28,260
you know just be like good soldiers way

654
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:35,260
you know smile nod and go out and do
what you gonna do anyway thank you also

655
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,400
for a great time

656
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,200
I think that actually a Korean
revolution is still coming

657
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,680
so I'm with you on that and I hear

658
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,070
is slow but steady this monster yeah

659
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,080
min you couldn't a I

660
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,260
actually here a contradiction what your
saying im hoping

661
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,080
this from a paradox yeah maybe so

662
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,790
I think that we need a very minimalistic

663
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,490
government because there are literally
crazy people

664
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:12,260
who will killers and win and they're
also

665
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,440
external foreign governments that
unfortunately

666
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,530
still are run by dictators who is only
goal in life is to

667
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:25,100
take us over whenever so I think we need
and minimal government

668
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,180
and a problem I see is that people are
fighting

669
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,740
like the lady just before and you seem
to approve more regulation

670
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:37,350
and I think we need less and what we
should advocate is a cleaner

671
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,520
as you say more visible very small

672
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,680
government yeah

673
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,070
I'm

674
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:49,270
I'm there's a there's there were a
number have

675
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:52,390
their Mike what you'd call prayer
contradictions

676
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,490
you what you just said but I'm

677
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,700
you know I

678
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,190
I'm all for I'm all for some government
I me I'm really

679
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,660
I'm really all for government does
things like you know

680
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,849
a mixture that that kids don't starve in
school

681
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:15,050
you know i mean and it seems like a lack
of sleep return a list ik but

682
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,500
I mean I i'm really all for government

683
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,369
that that makes it so that if if you
don't happen to have your medical card

684
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:26,320
when you show up in an emergency room
with two yr limbs of it they don't wait

685
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,839
around right if I know whether or not
they can admit you

686
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:31,880
and I'm no I I

687
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,359
they're just a lot of things that I
think government ought to be there to do

688
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:35,230
I don't I'm not

689
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:39,079
I'm not forgetting radovan entirely but
I'm

690
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:42,750
yeah but I

691
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:47,310
but I am for localizing it to the extent
possible

692
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,380
I because I think it that what we

693
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,690
what information technology is done is
to create this let

694
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:58,780
level a government that is exactly the
wrong level at about the nation state

695
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,010
level where there's so much information
that has to be processed at that level

696
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,030
that the whole system just urs September
late

697
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:08,420
and doesn't work anymore I mean is I i
expect to see the greatest

698
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,690
renaissance in the city state since the
Renaissance

699
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:15,160
because that's the part I'm that's the
pro-government that I think will work

700
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,220
and and and work interactively was irish
space well

701
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,520
then it is that a sign that says 0 also
saw

702
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,530

703
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:33,980
certain okay well edges of stop sign so

704
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,050
