9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:35,930
hard time hearing

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,170
I just a heads up this talk a swear word

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,309
like a lot of her room and some
depictions of violence

12
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:46,250
most of them are censored are some of
them are not I'm be offended if you feel

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,180
the need to leave in a

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,700
so I really love hip-hop

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,890
last summer and the new york city to ten
hikers cool new york com

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,690
into the home hip-hop and rap I love
that kinda music because I was really

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,600
great for them it's really good for
dancing:

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,460
but as women have issues with a lot over
there

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,020
and here are some examples and I'm not
gonna read it out loud

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,350
but good

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,660
I want a guy

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,780
I'm Yours them lyrics from the song

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,910
goldie by Aesop Rock You and so

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,640
I was kid can we quantify be measures
sexism

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,049
K on this is obviously kinda a complex
and so question so as a kind a first

26
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,190
approximation when I start looking at
was

27
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,299
well which proper uses the B word the
most

28
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,610
and so no one goes to Google Talk being
confused by the word I mean if it wants

29
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,390
an on-again I mean the word bitch

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,600
fancy you and though

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,020
to talk about this while we need some
rap lyrics and where can we get them

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,869
on this website corrupt unions and it's
like Wikipedia for wrapping has lyrics

33
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:54,470
from a song that you can imagine

34
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,680
and you can go on an atty them from
eating so for example if you didn't know

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,920
what those lyrics meant you could go
look it up on Oct

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,450
there's a there's no API so we need to
scrape

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,140
through the day side with was I got

38
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,850
on 32 artists from 5250 some each I got
a mix of

39
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,820
East Coast West Coast Dirty South rap I
got on male female black and white

40
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,019
rappers for total

41
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:19,400
2600 or so songs hope

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,329
this is for my friend it was like a I am
super way what is this for

43
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:27,989
East Coast West Coast Dirty South rap
they're talking about so

44
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:31,049
user some eager to list two-minute
history rap

45
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,450
it's not completely gratuitous because
like difference on the rap

46
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,560
involvement in contacts it does teams
like what people talk about in this

47
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,400
Tyler

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,720
so it does a fact like what we're gonna
do into

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,950
rap started on his cock on the East
Coast our new york is the best way to

50
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,269
rock the birthplace of hip-hop

51
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,690
and what you really need to know about
these costs rockets at its what's really

52
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,510
important to is

53
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,790
rebel cleverness an offensive virtuosity
I'm examples artist that you might have

54
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,139
heard over GZB small Missy Elliott

55
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:01,250
s up rocky would think I'm I'm gonna
play you a quick sample just to get an

56
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,269
idea what I'm talking about

57
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:07,850
is where I'm not sure if this can work
about that

58
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,720
cases we weren't 0

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,609
I do not think no idea with of

60
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:24,350
with inevitable so what's up

61
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:31,350
Bracewell yippee week did

62
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:35,290
up

63
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,940
best be you know with chip

64
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,220
jump

65
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,609
gonzo you he quit you can notice is the
B is quite repetitive it's pretty much

66
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:52,729
just one sample loop over and over in
the background and america clearly the

67
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:53,799
focus on the some

68
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,910
so rob was born on the east coast but
then it spread to the west coast

69
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,010
only in the beginning there was a lot of
jealousy basically because

70
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,040
on east coast rappers refused to
recognize that west coast rappers could

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,269
be any good so there was a lot like crap
feuds in the wild jealousy

72
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,489
on their allotted like shootings between
the coast which might have heard of

73
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,910
and are well you can but West Coast rap
is that it was the birthplace of gangsta

74
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,440
rap after releasing the concurrent come
on up there

75
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,910
I'm gangsta rap came out over the
situation we're in the

76
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,160
ease in the United States crock hit the
inner city really hard

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,130
it generated like an incredible
non-violence in terms of people

78
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,370
committing crimes tribunal two for the
drug

79
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,250
in terms of farm gangs fighting to
control who had the right to sell it

80
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,560
and in terms of the police response been
brutal to the point being militarized

81
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,060
on as I quickly this little video where
the police had tanks

82
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,960
Sophie firehouse was like a crack ho
Stevens like knock on the door and

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,840
arrest you they would like ran into your
house for the Jain tank

84
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,900
of course people are upset rain arm and

85
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,780
soaking struck him out of the centre
Blake while it's going how this music at

86
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,250
about dancing around in like being happy
imparting

87
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,830
but our lives are terrible like were
forced to sell crack to survive

88
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,610
arm the police's told the owner case
really unfairly this so much violence in

89
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,449
desperation and this is what we want to
talk about

90
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,970
and so this is kind of the the broad
themes with gangsta rap pins

91
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,430
and I'm gonna be a sample colors tree
and Compton by NWA which you

92
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,819
quite possibly heard before sorry for
the little

93
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:22,819
weird T

94
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:46,560
that's right on Compton

95
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,419
I'm two-week notice is ugly like a much
more aggressive field and the other song

96
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,150
from before

97
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,360
that looks a little bit hard to make out
but if we look very

98
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,520
aggressive on examples are listened to
not all

99
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,620
West Coast rap is going struggling
examples are just like Snoop Dogg doctor

100
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,870
dre A&W that we just heard Teague I can
really Kendrick Lamar

101
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,099
and finally the most recent style arm

102
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:10,949
is kind of called Dirty South and
refocus their substance cochran contract

103
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:11,349
I'm

104
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,319
we focus on work that's what you're the
most likely be here if you go to clubs

105
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,250
on

106
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,610
it's the more as a sub most recent style
and it's different

107
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,909
from the other ones in the sense that
the emphasis is really on the BU and on

108
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:24,840
creating offensive energy the lyrics are
basically secondary

109
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,050
often it's just kind of nonsense
repeated over it like if you know your

110
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,819
littlejohn

111
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,990
is very Lake archetypal love the style

112
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,610
I'm and it's very well suited it has
become very popular in clubs because I

113
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,039
mean a club you wanna sit there

114
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,780
analyzing complex poetry you just wanna
kinda you know get hyped up with your

115
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,330
friends

116
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,930
and so if you go to a club today that
cling hip-hop

117
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,960
most likely as we're gonna hear and so
examples or dislike littlejohn the Wayne

118
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,569
36 mafia TI to change outcast and here's
an example the song called up but in

119
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:55,650
Johnsburg to me

120
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:02,650
you hard

121
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,740
huh said

122
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,740
but just ok

123
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:26,490
just missed

124
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:33,670
much

125
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,020
again I kinda want

126
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,730
scoring hum so any luck I'm so any luck
from

127
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,620
said there is actual coding in Stockport
arm so

128
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,540
okay so what we need to do now is
getting word from we're gonna do this

129
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,480
and be free for parts rate so first we
need to download image to more followers

130
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,680
than we need to extract lyrics from HTML

131
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,940
on count what we're interested in and
we're going to be some more such as well

132
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,890
you into

133
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,660
script is not like having a nice clean
EPIA where you can say okay

134
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,660
you know I look up in the dark is the
function call I need to do it I get the

135
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,080
data

136
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,530
its it's very troubling here and it's
very messy problem every time it's

137
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,140
basically a new problem and you have to

138
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,530
look at the structure what you're trying
to scrape and to try to understand at

139
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:16,990
first

140
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,570
so if we look at rap genius we seize for
each

141
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,240
artists there's an index page that looks
like this with a list of songs so uses

142
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,960
up rocky

143
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,580
and you see on the locked is pretty much
like that a list of all his songs

144
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,610
and then so if we click on one song
other sung only that were looking at

145
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,130
earlier that was are so charming

146
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,300
on hear the lyrics we see there's a
header there's a sidebar there's a

147
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,880
widget

148
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,010
on and there's only a small part from a
page that we really care about if we do

149
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,340
you view source we get

150
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,320
basically 1500 lines a beach in mall in
CSS and Javascript and so on

151
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,390
on and of these fifteen hundred lives we
care about forty

152
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,560
you so at first the scene really
straightforward way I was like ok Ill

153
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,000
just he's beautiful see you can already
Lupino use your 11 which I've been told

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,640
like cocaine

155
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,970
no one call does that anymore like use
request on

156
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,250
and get all the files and not simply to
let things be safe or in

157
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,470
except nope so the first problem happens
is that I only get 20 file for each

158
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,110
artist

159
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,980
and doc seems like a problem because for
JJ's he probably has

160
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,420
a lot more than twenty some sort
something is going wrong and

161
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,420
the problem is

162
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,150
think

163
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,690
it my fear today

164
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,200
99 problems in getting all of them
actually story of my life

165
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,770
so if we if we look at the

166
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,140
the real page on rap to use what we find
the problem is auto scroll

167
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,540
and so how r school works if if you have
an in camera is basically

168
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,720
it looked up the first twenty songs and
then when you scroll to the bottom the

169
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,640
pages like okay

170
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,560
I need 20 more songs and then it kind of
goes like this: this is to avoid that

171
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,780
doosy probably has like 300 songs and
then maybe just care about the first

172
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,740
three in the have a huge page load for
nothing right

173
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,040
monarchy sweetie $1,300 song so how do
we kind of defeat this

174
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,630
so what we can do is we can load up look
far bugger chrome dev tools

175
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,830
and scroll down to the bottom of the
page on trigger the event and then see

176
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,760
where is it making in Jax request

177
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,420
and so when we do that we because the
pictures at the bottom at Sapphire bugs

178
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,550
so you can see it's like calling your
own we get the worst throw lever

179
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,410
60 discussing so okay this isn't about
at first cuz you like will

180
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,740
Parenthood has a pagination primary cost
route so we can say well

181
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,430
r8 pagination because of me all the
songs but

182
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,660
doesn't work either so it seems to
ignore this

183
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,870
and talking and then it's like while
there's a a primer call p.m. so in

184
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,560
theory I guess you could break the Euro
into like three parts with the first

185
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,200
part

186
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,270
the page into generator without in the
loop in the second part

187
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,390
at three in the third part and then just
like all the successively in get all the

188
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,560
pages one after the other

189
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,440
except that could even ask because we
also this for our did

190
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,070
for artist page ID here going on so now
for each artist we have to somehow get

191
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,660
this

192
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,780
and now it's not nice cleaned on parsing
it's like some giant regular expression

193
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,690
monster

194
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,630
gross thing I'm until then it's going to
take a step back and think

195
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,150
in was my goal to write the best creeper
whole time or was it just to get a bunch

196
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,770
rap

197
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,089
n this Irish like

198
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:24,130
packages tied to this on the handover
every programmer know which is

199
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,660
one is important for something to be
perfect for something to be done

200
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,470
and in our case it's like take it

201
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,839
thank you

202
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,390
on and in my case was like whoa you know

203
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,980
for nuclear submarine downloading rap
lyrics on like map Firefox plugin

204
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,520
so is a plugin called down on the mall
into what I did is I just like 12 the

205
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,270
peach trees up rocky and I click like

206
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,300
schools gross gross gross gross gross
gross cool download the mall in many

207
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,830
callers

208
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,900
and I did this for the next for 32 times
and was incredibly boring but I was %uh

209
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,190
and so

210
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,010
okay so where we are now now we flake
use down on the mall in two for each

211
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,410
artist we have a directory

212
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,910
with a buncha regional files represent
like one person for each artist and so

213
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,450
what we need to do is take this HTML and
for each song

214
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,839
internet into lyrics rate so we have
your party for problems we have you

215
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,010
tomorrow now when you mix

216
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,160
and so that we can use on initial use
beautiful soup which is really like

217
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,400
a nice straightforward screen scraper
are written in Python any channel purser

218
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,470
and I weed or use pattern which is also
an inch to more per sorry but it has a

219
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,250
lot of fun

220
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,330
natural language processing I
capabilities I think it's pretty New

221
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:37,920
Haven

222
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,570
her too many people that have used
before and yeah beautiful to this

223
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,200
fantastic

224
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,830
registered using pattern more just
because Dennis reading more on LP and I

225
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,630
who's a simpler to use the same tool for
everything and two

226
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,660
looking at the structure what we have

227
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,330
I'm we want to do is turn a tomato is I
get these things under the given

228
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,580
looking very quickly basically lucky for
us all the lyrics are just in this Big

229
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,060
Dave call their actions 0

230
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,620
we just need to do that I'm and using
part in this is rushi forward this is a

231
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,200
six lines of pattern including two lines
for opening the file in printing it

232
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,730
into you open the file you read the file
kid I kid in one line

233
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,830
you done if I the whole situation down
you get

234
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,650
say give me that dear with the classes
lyrics turn into plain tax which means

235
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,670
text album two new lines like
unknowingly

236
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,209
Nichole details an imprint and their
there are the first three lines have

237
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:25,800
called the

238
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,290
ever so charming sup rocking and there
you go

239
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,740
so locks thing we need to do is we need
to count the numbers be

240
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,260
arm and so pretty much for each artist
like count how many are in

241
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,850
each file told them up and then what
we've done is the average over the

242
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,589
number songs to make up for the fact
that he jay-z has a lot of songs but

243
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:45,930
like Queen Latifah has like it

244
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,630
small number of songs and but this is
not even a library a parchment I mean

245
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,980
it's just the regular expression library
just basically pretty much counting

246
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,720
matches in

247
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,089
their school one-line so result

248
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:02,110
on rappers are using the B word on
average twice for some

249
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,040
which is good about a musher Enzo

250
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,390
the robbers are the best you had like
I'd easy Missy Eliot encontre kalkaska

251
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,900
on you

252
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,620
looking to build a prize I suppressed by
Connie and easy cuz I don't think I've

253
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,690
them is very positive toward women

254
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,300
arm I was the women was really
interesting II with

255
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,930
thank I was happy to see that the women
did pretty well and then the socially

256
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,640
conscious rappers I was happy to see
their politics were kinda been mine with

257
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,680
some

258
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,690
the usage of the word up from one to
three

259
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,790
whisper song the STI be small fifty
signs

260
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,910
I mean I am Kendrick Lamar I was really
surprised they begin I'm not talk about

261
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,440
the morning second

262
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,360
arm and 323 three more those little came
Foxy Brown and whts up rocky Snoop Dogg

263
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,190
I was surprised because

264
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,430
basically a little complex in honor of
female rappers if you don't know them

265
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,790
and them

266
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,320
they were like amongst the worst Mike
that's kinda interesting

267
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,320
I mean so bad

268
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,270
so lucianne so bad he merit in his own
category

269
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,610
with 9.7 times per song arm

270
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,130
at which point I'm like it's time to
learn more words

271
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,339
littlejohn home

272
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,190
and so what going back to original
question which is a good matric for

273
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,520
sexism rate

274
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,600
and everything about this artist the
biggest montana a very violent lyrics

275
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,069
towards women that talk

276
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:35,410
about the killing I'm assaulting them
mining murdering

277
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,990
I said already that squirrel a Tivoli
law so

278
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,370
I mean I'm sick twice per song in the
small three times per song so

279
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,480
him okay to fuck it

280
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,300
help on and overlook examples alerts by
littlejohn in the small

281
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,150
I'm not going to say this out loud in
and I didn't warn you that there'll be

282
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,819
some I'm

283
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:58,980
on like pure

284
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,459
examples have lyrics by twine and the
first thing that you cannot miss his

285
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:03,300
little Jon Diebler

286
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,660
I needed to bleep out a whole bunch of
words but big a small arguably what he

287
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,390
saying it

288
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:13,790
much worth but you know there's no swear
words in it

289
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,910
into let's think about this so big a
small I'm number

290
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,920
the recognized amongst the greatest
rappers of all time biggest mall in

291
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,290
particular is known as

292
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,560
probably the greatest storyteller in all
rap the painting very vivid pictures

293
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,680
with his words

294
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,180
on both of them are known for their
their local talent a very clever

295
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:36,910
and I ok I have more songs about you mom

296
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,410
and so does example over a song called
party and bullshit by the small

297
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:49,410
map

298
00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:01,290
them

299
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,809
and so in the also you the lowdown from
right and who's the

300
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:15,780
to compare a song by Lil Jon day

301
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:22,780
Mac

302
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:30,709
me

303
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,050
and so you can definitely see it like
you and I told you nothing that

304
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,130
the to flee from different styles and
was a little bit the whole

305
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,420
you can see a little big is very famous
in from the east coast model John is

306
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:49,960
very famous

307
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,700
from the those who can see I think in
those samples pretty clearly the the

308
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,110
different styles but they're coming from
as well

309
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,840
into it seems to be that mike Beebe
smaller

310
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,920
a human enzyme refuse to play any songs
on but this thing done more vocabulary

311
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,940
just more skill to describe things that
are worse so

312
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,930
it suggests that the counting word like
the B word or some other derogatory term

313
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,910
for women is not a sufficient matric to
really evaluate sexism in

314
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,050
in music so it's like mmm hop

315
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,210
on not sure what to do next in so what
about

316
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,160
when dealing with data is if you're not
sure what to do next anne like wall

317
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,780
cannot didn't work out how I thought

318
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,490
good thing to use to play with data and
look for useful patterns to see is there

319
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,080
something in there that I can exploit

320
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,860
so one thing I thought of doing a small
okay you

321
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,540
I was really curious what are the 20
most common words in rap into

322
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,540
what's this is worse are really falling
in love with pattern which is basically

323
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,090
three lines a pattern which is

324
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,790
is the compile all your things into a
less than calling docs like that is the

325
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,520
function I wrote

326
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,490
on basically do this legal document
thing to it

327
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,920
I'm gonna talk the I'm excluding some
weird was all talk about in a second and

328
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,040
I basically just saying give me the top
20 words with a frequent account and

329
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,680
there we have it

330
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,970
so the most 20 common more than 2700 rap
song

331
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,760
antidote 1500 line each I'm not so

332
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,830
are basically the N word then we'll
prolly /url arm

333
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,180
morse wearing afterward the B word time
love

334
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,040
wanna Moneylife tar baby gotta magazine
real girl hit call look in the B word

335
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,580
perot

336
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,690
there's a problem with the pearls was
all talk about in a second

337
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,800
into

338
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,620
on the the list words I was taking out
earlier and as well

339
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,900
that like this whole thing exclude
rappers the issues are interesting in

340
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,190
person rappers dispersing other tax lien
friends i do research in this kind of

341
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:38,620
topic

342
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,170
using like French literature and
psychotic I had issues that they hadn't

343
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,140
on into I in our language processing

344
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,190
Stoppard's words are so common that we
basically don't I'm not the popular

345
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,360
arm are words that are so common that we
don't care about them

346
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,280
so it voted on and profitable on a slang

347
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,540
I'm into we need new stop weren't so for
example had tied job

348
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,420
damn Johar come on that and

349
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,310
so those words have to be parsed up
because they fear so commonly and

350
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,110
another thing is

351
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,870
I'm robbers often referred animals by
nick names that appear in the tax so

352
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,790
whole if I look to the top twenty words
for Jeezy was which is nick name for

353
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,470
himself with the top 20 word

354
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,120
on so you have to add those as well in
person so

355
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,310
and in rap it's also common to have
guess robbers

356
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,280
on diverse are to have like many
different rappers in the songs for

357
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,780
example

358
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,680
arm wu-tang clan the top 20 was all the
names of the members

359
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,930
and Enzo

360
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,770
a man so I can also when there's guess
rockers will see the name and the person

361
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,380
as the outsize the

362
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,410
to attach the first to the right person
into

363
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,580
one interesting thing that came out of
that was I'm in an I was really

364
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,720
one thing and is accounted Lee coming
times are people using the N-word I was

365
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,920
really surprised because I'm is a white
rapper that he was using it at all

366
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,140
and I was like hmm house at 90 and I
wanted to look into the song it was

367
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,060
because he had a guest rapper who is
black that was using the word

368
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,360
and the other thing is stemming
something is

369
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,130
the kind of I'm sure allowed remember
it's basically the process by which you

370
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,280
make Apple count with Apple so we saw
Lexie the B word in the B word pearl

371
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,310
that should really be one word in terms
of what does it mean to the tax

372
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,790
by like right now pattern

373
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,850
isn't dealing with this cuz I for
example I want ho to count close but

374
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,530
its thinking a cartoon home so it didn't
really work but

375
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,840
so so for for

376
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,490
arm so but you can pass in a custom
something function which I have yet to

377
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:36,930
rate

378
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,160
but this is probably a good thing I'm
gonna do sometimes really quick and all

379
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,210
what so what's even more interesting
than the most common 20 is

380
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,970
what makes wondered one artist different
from another for example are they really

381
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,650
weren't that

382
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,190
only big a small size and so what I did
is the added the 20 most common words to

383
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,820
the exclusion wordless to see what what
is big he saying

384
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,940
other representing I'm gonna go all you
can

385
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,600
look at the Kool Aid on site I'll go
quickly through is that we're running

386
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,150
out of time

387
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:07,150
into for big the top 20 the Ramada
really negative words there's like mad

388
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,400
mofongo hose afterward I

389
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,220
I hard game like a lot of cum sad words

390
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,590
and then a man on the earth on the F
word little boy

391
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,790
a sick bad mean so-called

392
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,970
before love sad words and if we compare
Tribe Called Quest which are more band

393
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,490
so she looks kind of like a

394
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,970
African pride in my partying in kind of
happy things

395
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,160
love the words have to do with dancing
like move rhymes be

396
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,920
people lyrics really qualified to live
in a universe I would sort of per for

397
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,670
the tribe call quest universe than the
M&M universe

398
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,570
and another interesting thing was I
socially conscious rappers that weird

399
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,310
people

400
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,770
arm was at the top %uh all over the
counter all them suffered a prize for

401
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,890
moral technique and for Talib Kweli

402
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,960
again up with the slide up on one can
look at them a bit more well

403
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,080
think on into I still have so many
questions so that the next thing that I

404
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,210
want to do is look at groupings weren't

405
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,920
into to feel like the windows a five
words if there's a word for women in a

406
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,050
word for

407
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,390
a harmful weren which is kinda suggested
would be a good approach by the

408
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,280
prominent to those words and stuff like

409
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,540
are Eminem's lyrics or begins lyrics

410
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,679
and then as well what I'd like to look
at is the sexism correlate with the rise

411
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,260
up gangsta rap because they found for
example that street harassment

412
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,510
correlates very strongly with

413
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,530
armed police harassment over minority
men

414
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,120
so when the final the police's like
randomly stopping and frisking people

415
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,660
and people are really upside

416
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,300
how they react to that as a way you
feeling getting a sense of power dock is

417
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,060
the only cross women like

418
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,800
in their neighborhood so interesting to
see if if sexism correlates with the

419
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,530
rise of Kings

420
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,710
in Eric's correlates with the rise up
gangsta rap of course

421
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,460
or or if doesn't correlate with the rise
of Club orient its really

422
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,890
bling bling make it rain kinda rap on
where

423
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,840
you know it's like to have my fancy car
and I have mixed rental car I have like

424
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,660
my hot girls

425
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,200
so these are questions and images in
continue to Texsport

426
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,570
I'm if your interest not come prolly
gonna be ready to pop some

427
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,830
please come check it out if you're
interested arm

428
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,820
and thank you so much and now I I'd be
happy to answer fan questions if you

429
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:16,820
have time

430
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,210
so I'm gonna start by confessing a bias

431
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,330
as old white guy who has training and
sings Ian routes based music I've always

432
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:28,669
found

433
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,029
rap to be executable arm and I wanna
thank you

434
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:35,730
for a fascinating talk that opened my
eyes to a number aspects of it that

435
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,539
I was unaware of um the

436
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,870
and the little disturbed by your
characterization

437
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,279
that they were forced to sell crack to
survive

438
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:49,990
but OK let that one go be poetry

439
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,120
go back in history all learned a lot
more about rap by studying

440
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,250
the history that involved it and not a
question but if you're looking for word

441
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:58,809
grouping

442
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:02,630
the term you're looking for is in Graham
rare and that

443
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,929
there are libraries for that that will
help you do that data analysis with

444
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:06,970
awesome thank you very much

445
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:11,760
and yellow thank you for the comment
will as well but be poetry II

446
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,429
are you had wished that there is a time
to go into him I

447
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:18,450
longer history Iraq but i dont wanna
talk about rap for half an hour

448
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,980
icon but let's definitely got one other
things are really

449
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,980
other properly came from thank you for
putting hi I just like to thank you in

450
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,590
some way

451
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,750
hands talk is shaping up to be a
probably the best one other day

452
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,590
it's going to be a much of an imposition
if I could go ahead and not some more

453
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,299
than one question

454
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:42,130
like a like

455
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,380
I'm number one I was wondering if

456
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,590
how which Rafi like the best and if you
tried running your analysis on

457
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,610
a a.m. practice from the midwest

458
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,899
and number two if

459
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:01,380
use founder I if you've managed to
conceive a way to

460
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,470
to analyze poetic meter and

461
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:10,470
finally one more question if I can I was
wondering if you've met

462
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,690
if you've looked into automatic
transcribing so that you can find a way

463
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,480
to analyze in school I freestyling

464
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,940
mom well a lot of Britain

465
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,299

466
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:25,399

arm I'm are you sure which went to enter

469
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,840
I guess maybe is there Canada is there
one in particular you want me to answer

470
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,020
in on you can talk about the rest

471
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,580
after I'm know okay to be tried running
this on on the Twitter

472
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,580
Mitt Midwest rappers like ideal Chris a
crane

473
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,169
home months as crew brother leaders with
people

474
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:54,399
I did got much I kinda focused on these
guys but I didn't want to start work on

475
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:54,950
this project

476
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,149
I did get a lot of requests from France
in can you run like it was a from the

477
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,649
requested type Tribe Called Quest

library called place while I say is you
may be able to analyze in this Sat Mar

488
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,710
by

489
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,880
looking at synthesizing the lyrics as
well like training in using some tools

490
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,210
like Markov chains

491
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,779
there's a I recall mark opted

492
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,940
use is powering a blocking games
programming

493
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,070
good mashes up the Bible with

494
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,500

00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,350
okay secondly I'm very interested

499
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,639
mistake research I've done some like
rhyme scheme

500
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:15,159
now sis kinda stuff with LTK I loved it
and

501
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:18,159
