1
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,009
good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,400
thank you so much for coming in joining
us today after lunch

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,210
I know you are quite sleepy but I hope
this is going to be a very exciting talk

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,310
arm Hitech is going to be talking to

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,960
us a little bad about like access al

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,269
you now that thing years please a big

7
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:32,269
round of applause frantic and Estonia's

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,989
cell shot quick poll are whilst the
difference between

9
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,489
SSL and TLS okay

10
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,649
mechanic it's good the S a few cedar shy

11
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,250
or in a very right room so I Munich

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:54,629
this is how I look on internet arm but
I'm not allowed on Twitter

13
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,809
are writing some other sort of the
program a good am doing infrastructure

14
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,250
at a small but friendly German opposing
company called are a major

15
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,580
where if you speak German to get you all
remains from but I want you to talk

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,290
about myself

17
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,100
I'm here to tell you I'll let those
shiny look i cant to tell you that

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,229
you're safe because of military-grade
encryption

19
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:15,939
our ally in fact I

20
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:19,640
you're on the road never really slept
and why the statement seem to

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,689
bits a controversial last week I assure
you

22
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:26,630
arm that in the grand scheme of things
absolutely nothing changed since last

23
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,360
Sunday

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,990
I'm arm you simply need to know how
things

25
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,880
fits together in are two assess and
minimize risks

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,820
and up uke you and your your search of
TLS

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,329
and others al can do much more damage
than any but will ever do

28
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,369
so before it

29
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:50,240
do our first trip to better and I'm
introduces only got the right down today

30
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,270
every other link and project and for
material I will be mentioned today

31
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,490
will be there especially more mature to
dive deeper into our concept I'm

32
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,049
introducing because at him

33
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,090
my thing forty minutes for a such
complex

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,790
I'm topic like RTLS way too little

35
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,340
cell now just relax and enjoy the show

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,349
what it why is the state of as all sorry
maybe should start at Ground Zero

37
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:18,900
and discuss what it actually is so what
as al

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,170
and what elle has it to do with Hillis I
think those terms are best explained

39
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,110
with a short history lesson because

40
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,170
everybody loves history lessons and all
particular one starts in the mid 90s

41
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,250
when it gets thought it might be pretty
cool if entering a credit card number

42
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,269
on the internet would entail people
buying drugs of your money

43
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:40,440
and so in 1995 they released their

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,040
completely host as a2 as the foundation
for a GPS

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,290
but as it stands for Secure not for us
as outcome

46
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,690
and the fix the most rock burst martz

47
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,830
one year later it has all three and

48
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,659
another three years later it finally
became an official

49
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:02,150
ATF standard and was renamed to key last

50
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,050
so again as El is a product from
netscape

51
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,150
from 1996 TLS San official standard for
fifteen years now

52
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,739
cell are basically a trick to inherit
the name

53
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,810
but everybody knows that deliberations
are always awesome

54
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,340
and I wanted to reach everyone I could
so if I had to trick you into the name

55
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,580
I hope you learn to first thing today
and will stop saying as a cell in a

56
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,220
future

57
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,090
you and 2006 and 2008

58
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,069
though largely ignored killers 1.1 and
1.2 have been released

59
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,890
both fixed several security problems

60
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,170
brought really nice features but nobody
cared

61
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,000
fast-forward last year for some polar
unreasoning

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,379
people started scrutinizing on security
habits again and what their phone calls

63
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,819
really not very good

64
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:56,819
so 41 all mainstream browser support is
only TLS 12 last year so kilos won from

65
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,040
1999

66
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,680
and the discoveries from arm

67
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,900
last year change everything the times
are just using TLS

68
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,549
are gone arm for price of Greta makes me
barry a suspicious than reassured and

69
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:11,290
some softer

70
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,760
claims to be secure because of TLS
actually

71
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,900
the mostly safe as a salvage make me RR
suspicious

72
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,780
sup you really need to know roughly

73
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,940
what you doing because this technology
has still very shop

74
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,550
edges and getting it wrong can have very
grave consequences

75
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,220
sup 10 Steelers actually want to provide
you with

76
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,139
first just pure entity using
certificates so you can verify

77
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,389
Europe connecting to do appear you
actually wanted to connect

78
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,009
another some crook who tricked you into
connecting to server

79
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,650
don't get to confidentiality using
encryption

80
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,840
saw people a disturbing on red rope
which is not

81
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,729
arming and a dark magic can sniff out
your secret in a password

82
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,570
this is what most people think of
anything else as LTL as encrypt are

83
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,240
cryptography in general but is only a
third of the whole package

84
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,520
the test pattern is I am message
integrity

85
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,220
saw I yet it the protocols able to
detect

86
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,060
when packages arrive mangled order

87
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,840
multiple times are not at all sought
thats

88
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,970
that's basically key lesson at natural
now

89
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,470
let's look om how to use those and
explain for details along the way

90
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,949
sup after spot to be able to from

91
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,110
spot reversed smells of parochial issues
such

92
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,650
and you will not want to be awarded on

93
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,550
and will start its servers unless noted
I'm sticking to open SSL

94
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,740
throughout the rest of the talk because
that's what we'll most likely be using

95
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,880
where you like it or not

96
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,020
sock an if you deploy server software

97
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,090
it's a duty to ensure the maximum
security for users because they can

98
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,220
neater see more affect your setup

99
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,949
so the first step is to use at least
halfway

100
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,000
up-to-date versions of their party
software if you deploy anything already

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,560
threatens today

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,199
W negligent lazy and should subduing so
and I'm generously assuming

103
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,550
that your installed all the security
back backport

104
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,729
pages from your solutions these are

105
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:20,660
the future releases you need to have a a
half a secure setup

106
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,100
a few TLS if if you don't

107
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,120
use that they're eleven back ports
there's obviously no up

108
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,440
no way you're deploying Obama's as a
Alderden 1.0 0.1

109
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,130
G which came alt Monday if you may have

110
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,560
hurt so

111
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,180
on the for think you do when a client
connects to you is that you present them

112
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,650
a certificate that's safe

113
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,050
Rio are which declined should verify

114
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,800
arm in order to make the climb a tree
trust the certificate to senate

115
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,539
it has to be signed by a trusted third
party called

116
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,979
our certificate authority RCA

117
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,360
the set of all public either all trusted
CA's

118
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,030
that can be used to verify the
certificate the signatures

119
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,470
is what we call a trust that the basal
trust store or

120
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,639
system curing depends on architecture
and a um operating system

121
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,430
outscored and to proof the certificates
actually yours

122
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,650
after all you send it out to everyone so

123
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,380
a secret keep a long siege certificate
this key is then used for signatures

124
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,440
that can be verified with the
certificate and the proof that you're

125
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,490
actually in a procession of the secret
key

126
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,300
already for mister roberts. heartbeat so
I'm

127
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,470
in the simplest case CS bout should be
verified that a certain host name

128
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,880
belongs to you by checking

129
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,300
that you get the money and control
against freedom and it's called host

130
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,220
memory vacation

131
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,539
and all certificates are really cheap
and Tom

132
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:55,069
you take the you can get them in for
free nowadays

133
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:58,759
on our side of the spectrum is Extended
Validation that obviously also means

134
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,139
extend the payment

135
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:04,530
and arm but get a company name into you
all bar

136
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,870
and it's basically or is to know
information about the validity

137
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,250
plus signature from personal for party
equal certificate

138
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,180
your job now is to make sure your
certificate setup is trustworthy because

139
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,889
a TLS

140
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,340
its rebirth less if connecting plants
have no way to verify

141
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,729
your identity sup you won't get

142
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:26,389
a certificate from signed by a trusted
third party arm

143
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,250
when you get a supply chain filed with
contains one or more intermediate

144
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,569
certificates

145
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,450
the complete the trust past 21 so in
this case are that

146
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,510
and trustee a signed some komodo
certificate which

147
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,029
and kept intern find some 100 promoter
certificate which in turn

148
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,060
finally site my certificate now when a
client connects

149
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,640
it gets all three of them and it can
verify to trust chain

150
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,790
so take care of the trust chain
forgetting chain certificates is a

151
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,750
typical rookie mistake

152
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,360
and sure the certificate is valid for to
host them up a server

153
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,120
and finally make sure that the
certificate is not

154
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,370
X expired because arthritis people make
fun of you

155
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,600
there's enough like not use plugins and
everything will for you in time so don't

156
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,970
let it happen

157
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,399
next is able as a to chances are it's
not necessary

158
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,140
bad for infant above Apple's a mess as
El still needs that

159
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,839
but I'm suggesting in any way that you
should deploy servers analyst and

160
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,930
because it through shouldn't

161
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,839
so arm if you don't have to support some
entiende operating system like Windows

162
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:27,779
XP

163
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:32,300
miss a bus 03 as well and finally
disable TLS compression to a white crime

164
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,200
attacks

165
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,339
that's about it the next objective is to
configure Cyprus it such a

166
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,480
every client gets the best possible
encryption and the best in this case

167
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,839
means

168
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,230
the most secure and also the fastest

169
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,300
I pursued is just a tubal there is
cryptographic primitives

170
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,620
one of them being a separate self that
are used together to secure connection

171
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,029
and other wanted to serve as the last
say about which supply pursued is used

172
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,410
so use the powerful powerful good and
thus efforts up

173
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,320
is the easiest to explain little star
them you can just imagine as a black box

174
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,720
it takes a plain-text paint if they
don't and a key as import

175
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
and return cipher text which should be
ideally interest

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,680
indistinguishable from random data as
output kill snipers are symmetric

177
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,990
that meets if you want to decry just
never text arm

178
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,740
there 11 function of the same for Neath
exact same key as the sender to

179
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,930
be able to be cryptid so far I think
it's pretty straightforward

180
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,709
these give up complicated on because
most diverse

181
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:36,970
on not maybe on most but though
currently most

182
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,720
popular once our blog re-entered I miss
you can just put

183
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,279
1 gigabyte move into it and reading for
a separate text come out

184
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,510
if your data is bigger number saffir
text then up

185
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,630
site for books I S which usually is 128
bits nowadays

186
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,640
you have to chop it up a bit smaller you
have to pet it so

187
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,839
obviously usually have to do both and um

188
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,959
the most common way for to do that is
are separable chaining

189
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,899
bitch unfortunately what's implement
that and ethical suspect poorly

190
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,000
in TLS which piece does with a wide
variety of attacks

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,399
I think the most known one is beast

192
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,899
cell the most common way it I'm to miss
a white that

193
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:22,200
at are still clan site fixes and through
ciphers like rc4 in the past

194
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,240
and touch up twenty and future arm

195
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,540
yet it's basically that current state
then kill us 1.2 brought

196
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,769
a shiny remote call to go lock on
promote which

197
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:38,769
does much more than just are chipping
and putting but more about that later

198
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:43,149
now we know what's my purse %uh are
which one to use

199
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,839
sup I would say that the to best current
SciVerse

200
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,149
are ates 128 in a goal a contra mode

201
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,860
and a stream cipher catch up 20% from
dan Bernstein

202
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,769
now ASU cm is better in heart rate and
trisha is better in software

203
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,430
so ideally you'd support both and the
clan decide which one to use and is

204
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,269
actually what Google does now a days

205
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:06,990
unfortunately it's not three Leah
available to us mere mortals

206
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,670
so simple catch up twenty is not an open
is ahead its

207
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,790
own in chrome up as far as I know they
are working on it to get it out

208
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,459
until then ATSG cm it is for now

209
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:24,200
so even for to latest Safari and IE
browser still have to fall back to AES

210
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,250
CBC same pfeiffer different mode works
perfectly fine details 1.1 and 1.2

211
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,269
I'm not so much on ps1 again beast I'm
concerts

212
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:38,920
so I you don't have really much choice
it them hoping that the client

213
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,570
has the relevant existence inode which
fortunately by now

214
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:49,870
are is true for all mainstream browser
so a poor Celeste wanted

215
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,040
sup and if you need to support engine
clients rate

216
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,209
in those XP in a paroled but there on
earth I would suggest triple the switch

217
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:57,990
is a decent

218
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,260
but very slow cipher the three basically
means that it's

219
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,490
takes the DS I phrase it three times so
you can imagine it's not the most

220
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,060
efficient

221
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,050
efficient thing to do and as it you
don't need anything else

222
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,420
to support everything you will ever
encounter in a net

223
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,820
and especially wary of the following
once so experts I first for

224
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,500
intentionally written and

225
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,750
when expert of crypto software arm

226
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,459
from the US their poems restricted so
where the middle coast at designed to be

227
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,120
easily credible

228
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,800
DS is the Dez attention pfeiffer

229
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,480
with 56 bikies are also it can be.

230
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,589
would force pretty easily so awarded
also

231
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:40,949
and finally RC force a bit more
complicated

232
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:45,089
some people considered as the syllable
the two of the most problems

233
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,209
does I'll beach till book Cyprus

234
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:51,860
have are shown over the years but on the
other hand own little cryptographer

235
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,870
I know of arabs I'm

236
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,160
of the opinion that it may be broken
waste that a national agencies

237
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,329
maybe already able to decipher it all it
it will be very soon so

238
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:07,470
based on what I've heard from people who
are way more smart and I am

239
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,019
a general and white against that cell

240
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,060
north to encrypt and decrypt Cyprus
needs a key

241
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,820
and since you're of talking about
symmetric encryption

242
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,079
it has even to be displayed in two key
so either way to agree Inc

243
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,139
on key East over for to encrypt them

244
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,260
connection which is not contribute yet
so we have a nice checking a problem

245
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,250
fortunately math come to rescue am gates
are several ways to

246
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,449
are exchange keys over and in secure
line

247
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:41,250
with alec you the keys and often three
are currently deployed

248
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,800
first there's are 8 which is not just a
company that took a lot of money from

249
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,720
the NSA

250
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,120
but its its also I'll

251
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,350
a public key cryptosystem so medical it
you have a public yes secret keyed

252
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,370
public you for encrypting secret you for
the crippling

253
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,620
straightforward the you that in kilotons
of very straightforward took

254
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,040
but as soon as a secret key

255
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,040
bleeds out of the server I am

256
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:18,070
I prepared at 10 but

257
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,089
all future and past communications
become plain text attacker

258
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:28,220
so we say it like perfect forward
secrecy ordered its not PFS

259
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,720
this bears repeating our one court order
one CE

260
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,990
are once they're a break-in and the
thief can decipher everything they

261
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,940
captured kept rebel capture

262
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,089
this is really bad no but its path to
peep

263
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,389
so especially operation folks really
like it

264
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:47,920
on Dell turned it used to be a are a
formal diffie-hellman

265
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,050
which is PFS but slow so apps don't Los

266
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,430
don't like slow and

267
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,620
finally nowadays we have though are

268
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,100
relatively new is CDH here is just that
the crib to

269
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,410
version of th you which means it's
faster and it's better to more secure

270
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,009
and you should really do everything
humanly possible to ensure perfect for

271
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,139
secrecy to everyone

272
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,610
and for that you will you need eat both
eche and DH

273
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,070
E and since CDH is faster s

274
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,029
suggest to prefer prefer it and ours a
should be really just a fallback

275
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,740
its should really on if you have to

276
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,110
so finally

277
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,740
message authentication codes or max our
youth message integrity

278
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,550
messages in TLS just means RTLS records
or

279
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:43,190
a lump of data that is sent out and arm
received an impact

280
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,630
the up makes I'm not kill a specific
don't let the broad

281
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,180
a message comp are confusing anyways

282
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,350
song they combine some magic crop dust

283
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,449
together with our shared secret key is
to ensure both the integrity

284
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,519
and the authenticity of single messages
so

285
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,639
if you have a message you know it at
this exact message how you had

286
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:07,130
arm will send by the person who knows

287
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,400
the shared secret key in that or

288
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,100
sup pls uses a so-called keyed hash make
your age make for that

289
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,329
you at least arm and before that as

290
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,400
you something similar but slightly
different

291
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,789
them and kill us 1.2 com

292
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,199
it was introduced that some efforts can
bring to own Mac

293
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,669
with them and this is very
aforementioned de la contra mode tryin

294
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:32,929
speak ass

295
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:36,990
it integrates to message authentication
within the cipher mode

296
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,890
which means it's not an ex extra step it
can be a nicely implemented in hardware

297
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,940
this is the future sup

298
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,350
finally if your list does not contain
only are throng

299
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,990
perfect forward secure certain a Cyprus
make sure that your own list and order

300
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,929
of Cyprus

301
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:57,080
has the higher priority casts its

302
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,330
its first light left the latest and
greatest arm yes implementation

303
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,580
if the Klein sense you a list with ours
a triple than a top

304
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,580
and you comply although you could both
have done the CDH a yes DCM

305
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,590
top and you're done wife told you here

306
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,539
you're basically done however thinking
and you've got it right

307
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:20,760
does mean absolutely nothing you need to
test a result

308
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,570
on desk really a much lot of confusing
stuff that can happen the for example

309
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,240
just run into our

310
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,160
rail slash central 6.5 which has a
decent

311
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,370
up messes oh now but the engine X is

312
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,840
to compile against the OPP although
missus all that means that almost as old

313
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,630
house you

314
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,740
oh yeah I can do is to be achieved no
problem and then you scan your own are

315
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,160
engine expand nato soon open so that

316
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,460
always tested and if your service HTTPS

317
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,470
it's your lucky day because then you can
just use the Qantas as is also a test

318
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,590
and sis is a pretty common case I
figured

319
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,820
I'm going to show you how to reduce
output using the results of my home page

320
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,630
I like to ask stressed that they test
much more them I will be able to talk

321
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,570
about

322
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,400
so after i've done the basics and three
years go back and get it as green as

323
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,010
possible

324
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,140
always m from a plus it's not that hard

325
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:18,460
sup this certificate as valid from my
homepage both with and without trouble W

326
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,679
it valid from March until next May

327
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,350
and as a for KR a key and this case to
meet Starz

328
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,470
a is used for are cryptographic
signature us not for key exchange the

329
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,419
same algorithm

330
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,390
but the different use cases and it has
completely different implications

331
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,710
other possibilities would be a ideas s
which nobody uses

332
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,260
and ECDs a richest gaining some traction
lately

333
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,049
because it's pastor truth about arm

334
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:49,230
its grossly under supported by both CA
ce and clients

335
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,770
so you first have to find a c8 science
hooky and then your have to find

336
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,950
I now and then you have to do a dual
threat to get set up like Google last

337
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,580
saw you

338
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,850
support both um

339
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,789
as farce a key step for case the current
state-of-the-art key size

340
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:12,169
2k is badly enough and 1k is a serious
security problem

341
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,240
sup it whilst issued by the como to see
a and they signed a certificate using

342
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,460
ours in shot to

343
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,570
which is nice shot to it which should be
our striving in OI days

344
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,110
show one has been mostly are being
deprecated in but honest

345
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:31,030
so 00 it has no Extended Validation
because I don't support it kinda Reckitt

346
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,320
and um it's not revoked and that

347
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,500
stuff its trust that which is wonderful
self protocols

348
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,600
always ensure that kills 1.1 1.1

349
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,640
are ek active and as a tourist inactive

350
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,570
because we have customers the demand
minutes XP support you now

351
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,900
you have to keep as a three on but if
you don't

352
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,480
don't carry that burden drop it

353
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,330
sup seven suites Terry go their dis-
currently

354
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,220
best widely supported Cyprus it if you
want to have it up there

355
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,480
you know it's readable nice sup let's
look in detail

356
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,690
it is the fast and forward security 384
key exchange

357
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,780
it uses Rs a four signatures

358
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,610
which is not something you can configure
its depending on the type of Yuki

359
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,350
arm yes I first already priced 8 yes 128

360
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,789
in Golconda mode and finally to use a
shot 256

361
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:31,419
for a key derivation are

362
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:35,539
if the cipher will there are classical
one that uses

363
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:39,549
external age make it would also use dis
hashing function for age Mac

364
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:44,700
isn't so it wont arm as you can see the
Cyprus strictly prefer earth

365
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,130
PFS I first all over non PFS once

366
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,710
which are again just because 1106 Peter

367
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,860
now heartthrob the privilege bro the
view if you are deploying something

368
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,890
different than about applications
compared to

369
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,909
I use six some some SATs are

370
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:06,230
especially males the server setups which
are some

371
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,370
in turn set up in the nineties and it's
the running

372
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,480
it can look like a sweet dream so your
mileage may vary very here

373
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,210
sup a thought about writing plan for
their next and turns out

374
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,120
that browsers aside the translators of
TLS Syniverse triple all

375
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,840
just slightly off because they're on one
job

376
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,640
verify verified a certificate to serve a
sense you

377
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,940
is it valid or is it expired it does the
trust invalidate

378
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,669
and finally is the certificate valid for
the hostname

379
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:40,900
you want to connect to especially host
the modifications

380
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,590
Sina such a pathetic state there's even
a scientific paper about it helped

381
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,429
foster does not verify hostnames

382
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:50,490
saw and unfortunately it

383
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,600
ok matters I'll has no little part in a
says Khloe solar thermal stress change

384
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,730
first thing is that certificate
verification up im

385
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,750
I guess what you have to tell Obama's
explicitly which the age to trust

386
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,570
and unfortunately it trust or so how the
platform dependent every less held

387
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,470
elsewhere

388
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,330
fortunately there is a function on
properly configured systems

389
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,690
in other read your default Russia ca3
compared and Pat

390
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,600
not for some very odd reason arm it
completely under command that I had to

391
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,789
dive into darkness

392
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:24,940
a source go to our verify what's
actually doing

393
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,260
and also near Oxford file and directory
bests

394
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,169
trust source which basically means that
does not work on Windows or west 10

395
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:37,299
well and as if ab muscles of cycle some
bad enough

396
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,809
our the year operating system vendors
make it you know a bit more miserable

397
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:44,860
soft of

398
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,570
do you have to install your trash out a
visit by hand are you get very

399
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:54,120
beard errors so for previous do you have
to install see a rude and assess

400
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,120
on keepin redhead you have to first
glimpse of

401
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,510
across but from consistency because the
pictures the set name:

402
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,850
om are sent you can either use

403
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,370
Apple's engine up messes oh that you
shouldn't and figure out the crux of the

404
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,789
page to entrust elation

405
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:13,990
agent which cost me like a week of my
life

406
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,460
and are you going home brew which
picture does something nice

407
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,440
I'll they just create a copy on
installation of the system trust other

408
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,409
base and use that that it's not optimal

409
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:27,059
because if you change something to
assist in kitchen for a reason it's not

410
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,440
reflect that but it's better than
nothing

411
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,710
for Renault stairs min Thurston pappy
I'm which Ruth

412
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,059
very fine and finally if you want to
dodge the bullet completely

413
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,679
which sometimes is the best I you can
just use 35 from pie PI

414
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,169
which is a python package of months of
trust database

415
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:47,980
so going on to a hot summer vacation

416
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,190
it is even worse because ok mothers out
literally say yes

417
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,210
there's absolutely no assistance
whatsoever from old masters else I'd

418
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,220
to verify better a certificate is valid
for a hostname

419
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,279
nothing there isn't information on their
argumentation

420
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,900
so everyone has implemented themselves
using our cease

421
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,830
and %ah bogus are advice from Steak
overflow and

422
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,340
up of course it's raining security
problems all the time

423
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,990
I meant I think the peter is no
exception sup

424
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,059
failing to verify certificates is really
bet

425
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:28,840
because it makes 63 miss a special tool
man in a middle attacks

426
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,549
so if you don't verify birth certificate
that all bitch

427
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,750
as I'd like to remind you est the up as
to our default

428
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,950
you for behavior I can pretend to be a
Google

429
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,110
with the south and certificate I can't
read in five seconds

430
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,000
if you go to fight a certificate I don't
compare hostnames agassi be a Google

431
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,799
I just have to use the certificate of my
home page was perfectly trustworthy

432
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,460
invalid

433
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,919
Justin for hosting but you want now
because he didn't look

434
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,570
so but if I'll thinks

435
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,520
on if there's only one thing you take
away from the store please let it be

436
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,309
this

437
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:05,360
everything else is that if a crisis just
Monday in

438
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,880
limit acceptable ciphers to strong once
four times with pre-configured service

439
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,270
like every day

440
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,059
and there's a bus is a2 thats all

441
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:19,200
and yet so if you do it it the perfect
storm of ignorant on one side

442
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,880
and operating systems and opposite all
making it unnecessarily hard on the

443
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,600
other

444
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,130
stop and real finish with the weakest
link up a security cheney users

445
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,039
up you

446
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,080
they can make everything fall apart art
no matter how much the rest of the

447
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,140
spektr ice to

448
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,600
keep them secure and usually starts with
for the middle misconceptions

449
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,720
sup what the skills that you want to do
for you for example

450
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,010
it's nice that you connection to your
mail so are you up Tessera secured the

451
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,240
latest and greatest cipher

452
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,600
that's great because people won't be
able to steal passwords

453
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,059
art keep doing it but from the

454
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:04,000
person disconnect but that your pot nice
connected using a plain-text connection

455
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,510
are

456
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,539
some intermediate server is compromised
which happens

457
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,470
are you confidentiality level for this
conversation is zero

458
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,909
and since you can tell if that's
happening you have to always assumed to

459
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:16,380
burst

460
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,450
out killers only offers security for
direct Pierce

461
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:24,090
you will need some additional are layer
security if you need confidentiality for

462
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,820
n2 and connections for example or PGP
for email

463
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,000
RTR fall up for chat

464
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,309
then there's the problem that certain
data can't be interrupted

465
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:36,820
if you serve a job site you broke over
HTTPS

466
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,240
take you'll still know that you're doing
at the cast your DNS queries in a

467
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,179
traffic patterns which

468
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,179
all give you away for that you will need
BPN

469
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:47,690
or poor to get to your privacy but

470
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,279
I'm bpm route all your traffic 30
network

471
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,309
so arm you better make sure that you
trust them

472
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:59,450
and this just as well for example
applies to content delivery networks

473
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,760
succeed in pryor's can read oil traffic
unencrypted because

474
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,020
they do TLS termination for you so arm

475
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,460
St could sniff oil pipe yeah I password
if they wanted to

476
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,899
which Dept don't want to go to great
guys as Donald told me but

477
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:17,029
they could sup does another reason

478
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,490
to never ever reuse passwords in any
case because you never know which the

479
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,049
party is gonna see it

480
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:29,399
sup makes are if you have a click away
such warning

481
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:33,850
you may have been MIT and you

482
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,870
they're awesome book investigative arm
Inc and then

483
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,890
use your best judgment so I am

484
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:43,870
if the certificate mismatches just the
supplement like here

485
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,610
and you know to circumstances like that
twister didn't support us and I in 2014

486
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,710
them you're probably fine if the
certificate is OK

487
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,130
and arm just expired five minutes ago
you're probably find two-income

488
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,850
to some snarky tweets them make fun of
people on IRC

489
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,950
but if you don't understand what's going
on there

490
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,950
never accept always decline man in the
middle a text ap really really easy

491
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:14,340
on public networks all it takes is that
it's a rogue DHCP server

492
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,450
cell and the next level of picking
mindlessly is the sum crook

493
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,220
tricks you into installing day root
certificate into your trust other base

494
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,380
because that means it every other I'll
certificate is signed

495
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,039
with that will be considered trustworthy
by your system

496
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:34,840
so we will never ever get a morning
Quinta MITM you

497
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,010
and if the user doesn't screw up

498
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,080
there's so much that can move wrong so
trust on a business

499
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,740
assist quick recap is are with a brozak
barry's

500
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,380
I try to determine that a certificate
chain it got from the server

501
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,500
is ultimately signed by trust 30 CA and
it happens to be true

502
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,649
that you browse a trustee a switch make
us some discomfort to

503
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:02,279
this means at the United States
Department of Defense

504
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:06,309
can easily sign any certificate in a
vote for any host them in a row

505
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,580
and there will be a a nice little lock
in your

506
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,140
not bar and fought like China standing
back or something

507
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,049
every country has some CAD CAM
compromise

508
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,779
and it alone unheard of of CA's being
hacked

509
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,399
making fatal mistakes being forced to
cooperate with authorities

510
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,779
or simply belonging to corporations
those priorities maybe not quite match

511
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:30,409
yours

512
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:33,419
so for example just Wiley examples

513
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:37,220
Microsoft and Google are both CA ce
whatever it means to you

514
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,059
and this wall system is just broken

515
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:48,059
sup

516
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:53,880
speaking of broking

517
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,190
let's talk a lot path now and its

518
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:02,240
let me sabra simple rule of thumb: as
i've seen people love to scrubbed TLS

519
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,330
thought if it somehow possible lead
battle-tested saw for Hannah lead for

520
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,210
you

521
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,210
especially if you just deploying that
applications a properly configured

522
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:16,070
engine X Apache in front of it most
really save you a lot of grief

523
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,370
I am there but what is it and

524
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,110
there's to plan your information on the
internet how to our

525
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,960
how to configure improperly which is
simply not true for some random

526
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,279
patton more you on pipe EI which just
ended killer support because someone ask

527
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,940
for it on my bike trigger

528
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,820
but since life you were in that simple

529
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,159
let's get our hands dirty anyway by 50%
less

530
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,179
landscape can be roughly divided into
two parts on one side

531
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:47,159
as the standard libraries as italian
mature I don't underside

532
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,529
are espy must sell and we'll start with
a

533
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:54,720
include batteries it turns out that in
all versions before 3.3

534
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,600
a pretty rusty arm

535
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,490
and money even that even the latest
Chinese version 3.4

536
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,179
has due to backwards compatibility
requirements

537
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,529
pretty terrible default so for example
host number to get you still up

538
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:13,070
in all the code is der at mad at the
situation

539
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,269
you wish for unpacking to because

540
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:20,190
I'm the coverage of of messes else

541
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,090
API really really poor so it's
impossible

542
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,750
too bright forward secure servers in
Obama to celebre says

543
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,429
a model which means you should never
ever right as killer servers

544
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:34,500
with opens me the can start library

545
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,409
it's also missing a bunch of option so
you can disable as a to you can't

546
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:38,990
disable

547
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,549
are kiss compression it's all a reset

548
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:45,809
and finally arm it bound

549
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:49,029
Tudor are open SSL your papers is

550
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:52,529
built against so if you want then you up
messes elders in

551
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:55,789
you have to recompile apartment which is
not very nice

552
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,909
also missing 2.7 is host memory for
cation ma'am I think stress enough how

553
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:00,899
important this

554
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:04,279
so that has been edit in Python 3.2

555
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,350
and fortunately and has been back ported
for piping to answer bail on pipe EI

556
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,799
however you have to remember install it
use it it's double

557
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:14,950
up in piled miss L

558
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,659
comes from a talent stomach libraries
I'll support was even worse than what

559
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:19,240
you have

560
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,760
now I think it even started his left for
and hat you make the state

561
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,110
how much quite sure they're arm

562
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,890
drunk on all relevant path in Greece and
although it has been a bit dormant or to

563
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,659
time

564
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:36,019
om it has a much better are API coverage
then marched at library

565
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:39,179
on I thing to the only notable omission

566
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:43,299
of TCD sorry on another long mission is
currently CDH

567
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:46,890
you for servers about the pirate pull
requests they are

568
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:51,990
and I am I have high hopes the discs
will get merged in its Prince

569
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,720
but what's more important and you
project give piled missus L

570
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,179
I knew my god cryptography if you've
been to talk of Poland Jerrett

571
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:06,039
arm if you learn you should watch the
video because it's highly interesting

572
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:09,300
you may have already heard about it it's
a bunch of piping people with more time

573
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,020
and sense

574
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,089
and with %uh average favor

575
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:16,649
a bad life the decisions arm came
together to write

576
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:21,500
a pattern cripple a break without food
guns be cast we don't have such thing

577
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,829
om a site product update a pipe I
friendly see if I bindings

578
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:30,619
problem as a cell so and it's trivial to
choose the opposite other room

579
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:33,990
and arm a bike ends like secure
transport

580
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,790
are in the works so get your go to fail
in patent to

581
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:42,810
am arm the skiff poemas are some serious
momentum a cast

582
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,399
nigga throughout all their rusty see
coat and

583
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,230
stuck concentrate on building Peyton
obstructions on public debts or pay

584
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,409
almost cell is something less release

585
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:56,750
a patent only version which a patent
only package which is nice

586
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:03,150
Anna what unfortunately missing their as
hot summer vacation

587
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,570
maybe see a pattern here although

588
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,720
in this case poems that three tries to
be a prepper for API so

589
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,240
M I would cut them some slack here bad
yeah

590
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,099
but again how does on poppy I sorus
identity gives do just that

591
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,750
plus some more obscure race 2 verify the
identity of a server

592
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,680
arm which nobody will ever use but they
are specified in RFC so there it is

593
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,910
and again the blood in install

594
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,599
use and let's look at

595
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,220
I knowledge through somewhat first you

596
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,160
let's look at common frameworks and
packages and how will behave tell us

597
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,420
on since the Oct ok sorry

598
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,240
are they will serve it service again %um
pledge event G unicorn

599
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,990
and tornado all suffer from the same
disease which is called star Larry

600
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,730
up they cannot have PFS they cannot have
good default because it

601
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:04,339
they can't use it options sop put an
engine X in front all of them

602
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:07,500
arm twist that you its

603
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,800
then

604
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,910
on it's probably one of the few alleged
reasons to cope with TLS yourself since

605
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,790
its used to implement much more

606
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:25,210
protocols than just arm just HTTPS

607
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:29,510
arm a little known fact of to assist
those ships had a nice risky containers

608
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,599
so in other words you can be plotted
your

609
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,770
you can deploy HTTPS but applications
with it

610
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,810
I without putting anything in front of
it and still have great healer support

611
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:45,270
and I can assure you arm that the plane
was kept on Twitter does not mean that

612
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,950
you have to use called XT for arts

613
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,660
or use can look at the new coats

614
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,010
cell finally micro is key it's not
packed with pacific despite the

615
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,369
convincing name

616
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:01,060
I'm so they just went on and brought
them see themselves

617
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,230
so that made a masters of their own fate
and indeed their implementation looks

618
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,589
pretty much fully featured

619
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:10,079
I personally with all still always put
an injection from it

620
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,730
because I have a general distrust
towards arm

621
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,790
ok masses are using CP coat I'll your
mileage may vary but

622
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,160
shouldn't really saw the only way to fix

623
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,230
only thread acres there is to your move
to Python 3 write your own SSL support

624
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,650
like my crew risky

625
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:32,390
or arm and poor to impaled myself

626
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:37,900
as long as we stay on our on standard
library of patent to

627
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,400
now gonna stay well maybe not but I've
talk about the letter

628
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,750
so client site event and you meant are
they are just as bad as before

629
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,000
although it is possible to do better.
despite a standard library

630
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,240
and tornado shows how the ship I'm not
entirely audited

631
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,130
trust database from a tool up and depend
on the hostname a chip

632
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,280
hostname matching arm back port from pie
PI

633
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,470
so they verify certificates and
hostnames by

634
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:08,109
d-fort imagine with on writing a paper
engage in a truck from Peyton ideas

635
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:12,460
but on the other hand this to run into
problems like the inability to

636
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,710
disable as a tour because that option
has been added in Python 3.2

637
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,700
that causes some really funny a roasting
a try to connect to certain service

638
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,570
on August 10 which still has as a to
incite to just get a protocol are only

639
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,599
don't know what's happening there

640
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,240
om yeah to STATS a client site is

641
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,070
complicated but for reasons you might
think defer to also man kamel case just

642
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,520
government after a while

643
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,130
it's complicated because nobody left
them glitter conspired with all current

644
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,170
Release Manager a hawk all to sabotage
my preparations

645
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:49,310
on you frankly started

646
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:53,589
to pull all nighters after he saw my
original slide 22 just had to use a

647
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:54,849
third-party library

648
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:58,690
from the dentist for two threat and arm

649
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,730
the current state as of this morning
when I checked the last time

650
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,760
I'm is that there are

651
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,380
up in up in low-level waste to verify
all %uh think so the plumbing his status

652
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,400
is great

653
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,670
I wondered high-level API Slyke ATP
agent or

654
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:19,170
as island point are still oblivious by
default

655
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,710
are this is not optimal bad at least it
is possible to write secure code which

656
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:23,990
is

657
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,079
was not before Sabha 414 not 0

658
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,300
and yet we take this issue 3 seriously
so R

659
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,920
this is going to get fixed its all its
all underway

660
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,890
am i expect to that fourteen point one
will be pretty good

661
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,930
what's never going to be good this
system will embrace your lip

662
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,609
comp it doesn't verify anything I

663
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:51,210
it doesn't said any options just hands
all but you ever have to open the HTTPS

664
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,550
you're aware that insert is requests

665
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,980
I'm something

666
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,859
oh man I have to carry up something %uh
the request is great because it simply

667
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,839
PI I'm

668
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:08,089
already ate like even more is that it
uses Europe 3

669
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:12,040
to get the best possible results cell it
always very bright

670
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,630
verify certificate always very feisty
hostnames

671
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,940
and everything just gets better
beautiful piled missus elena few under

672
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,540
our modules

673
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,599
yeah thought let me sum up to kill us

674
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,770
out of pipes if you can use requests for
HTTPS curry's

675
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,940
make sure you're using in the pile
misses a bike Marin

676
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,089
and red Kia sorus interested

677
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:39,220
if you need Lolo TLS use the latest
version of piled missus 0

678
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,349
it's greatly superior to pipe B-two's as
only you and it will follow unfaithful

679
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:45,460
if you have a part to play in three

680
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,510
final it you still pat me too standard
library

681
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,510
only for a client and only have to
really need to a arm

682
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:55,780
and it leads to say whatever you use
make sure you use the relevant back

683
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,380
ports and tools to verify all the things

684
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,040
soft let's answer a question from the
very beginning why is the state of

685
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,020
SSL sorry

686
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,510
it's alright because people still say
SSL although it's been a plea for 15

687
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,099
years

688
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:18,730
it's alright because implementations are
terrible

689
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:24,700
all of them I'm not sure if you expected
me to ran for an hour

690
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,500
about how and why implementations are
terrible in my bed been fun

691
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,410
but I am it for the reconstructive way
to I love my speaking pamphlets

692
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,349
leave it at that if the state of a
message I'll makes you angry

693
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:41,930
which redshirt I consider donating for a
project or tell your boss to donate to

694
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,540
the project because it's literally three
guys and one of them gross full-time

695
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,349
so it's better than it could be

696
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:53,510
salt it sorry because you just run to
lead software

697
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:57,869
the click certain I'll certificates
morning awake and out the mercy of third

698
00:41:57,869 --> 00:41:58,810
parties

699
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,720
and other parties let them down
regularly service from completely

700
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,410
outdated software

701
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:08,280
that is confused configured completely
poorly

702
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,819
clients and verify anything although if
their only job and

703
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:16,329
we're not talking yell so obscure free
very here this January

704
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:19,670
I O active found forty percent of Tesla
banking aP's

705
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,369
to be vulnerable to make him a text and
up

706
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:26,980
finally it sorry because patents in the
forefront of being terrible

707
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,349
the current state really is sorry even
without heartbeat

708
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:34,550
artist the title of this talk is not the
tension bed but there's help

709
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,240
for the vault people started to Karen
question for that's probably be by your

710
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,329
here

711
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:44,960
arm acceptance is always the first step

712
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,810
good ap

713
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:53,910
standard library support the better by
making it uses the 3.3 release

714
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,000
so if you're ever near the reason for
patent 3 for your boss

715
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,400
here you go and even for Python 2.7

716
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,940
Nick colon is working on a pet that
should bring in SS among your roughly

717
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,480
into

718
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,780
out to 2014 so there goes who argument
for Python 3 a.m.

719
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:14,850
arm I've already mentioned a
cryptographer project much much more

720
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,320
than that in a proud tradition

721
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,640
of the piping packaging authority a
python cryptography authority from

722
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,350
formed on a bit obvious already adopted
several projects

723
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,900
and it's supposed to be a once a place
for solid purpose of her fur pie from

724
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,960
at this is a real huge deal because the
standard library simply moves

725
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,570
too slowly to a response to the pressing
issues of security

726
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,620
arm but hope also means there's work to
do

727
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,030
therefore I call selection

728
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,430
stop believing that the look I can't
makes you and your data safe

729
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,210
do not click away certificates warnings
away do not in Seoul Roque

730
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,440
route certificates be a critical user
configure or service properly

731
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,330
install security updates immediately if
you connect to servers

732
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,840
verify the circum- you verify
certificate

733
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,800
and hostnames and finally help us to get
paid out of this mess

734
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,410
pixel libraries fix your software report
backs upstream

735
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:13,680
huh a few pics he's backs there's really
a lot of two to do

736
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,840
and that's all I have for you today

737
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,640
I hope you learn something and more
importantly I eager to fix things

738
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,560
now so go out stay atop H follow me on
Twitter get a comment from our media

739
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,680
and look out for a trip to open space
that will have it probably tomorrow

740
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,680
thank you

741
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,829
thank you very much

742
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:48,680
unfortunately we have no time for
questions but where will you be

743
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,980
in Eq yet catch me our kitchen outside

744
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,329
I will have a real cryptographer next to
me will arm

745
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:58,890
hook kick me if I'm gonna say something
wrong

746
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,150
I would have been more comfortable two
and three on the record anyway so

747
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,809
catch me outside him thank you very much
