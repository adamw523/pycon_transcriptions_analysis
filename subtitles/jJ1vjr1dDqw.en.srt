1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,350
sorry I welcome this afternoon session

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,360
I now we're gonna hear from their jack's
not be but helicopters

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:23,360
so so the total my talk is cheap
helicopters

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,800
in my living room I am my name's know
Jackson lovely on their jail on the

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,490
twitters

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,320
I the slides are up on my website NJL
.us

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,809
on so the whole point my talk the
purpose yes I I hope to know the

8
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:40,540
helicopters

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,680
I'm but I'm can talk about using up
papon

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,570
an Arduino together I'm I talk to people
about this a lot

11
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,420
and they say oh you're right pat you run
python on your tween oh and I don't know

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,870
that doesn't really work that way I just
try to

13
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,070
right as little on the road we know as
possible now my pocket offer

14
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,890
certainly take Python write a card we
knows where to put them together

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,550
with helicopters and do awesome things
I'm

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,810
this is all transparent attempt to get
%um doing awesome things

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,660
right I'm so are tweeners are the
gateway drug so

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,110
helicopters I'll talk about helicopters
our first

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,900
cuz they blow my mind that they work at
all and the fact they've been around

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,690
before like computer-controlled these
things

21
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,409
is insanity so I'm this is the Simon s
wanna 7g it's less than twenty dollars

22
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:29,390
on Amazon

23
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,990
you can click Buy It Now on Amazon

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,930
and I'll be waiting for you when you get
home this is where Pete this is a

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,070
helicopter

26
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,409
for less than twenty dollars that could
be waiting for you at home

27
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:49,090
okay so all talk about the details it
has lotsa features and I get a list of

28
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,869
all the features and some things don't
seem like features

29
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,689
but trust me when you're buying
helicopters for less than twenty dollars

30
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:59,090
some things are very definitely extra
features

31
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,360
okay so it goes up and down most of them
do that

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,840
it rotates left and right sick and
twisted left and right

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,380
it goes for him backwards that's
actually an awesome feature I have one

34
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,519
that only goes for words

35
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:13,940
um it has a blinking light I which

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,639
which sounds useless but trust me that's
pretty heady to I'm it has a USB charger

37
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,030
I am so you don't have to go dig around
for dozens of like these

38
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,590
you know AAA batteries also other stuff
I'm but the coolest feature

39
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,609
kahane the course features that is less
than twenty dollars in Amazon

40
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:33,079
on the second course feature is not in
for a protocol that controls it has been

41
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,410
reversed engineered

42
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,019
to somebody else has figured out what
this delightful little piece of hardware

43
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:39,639
does

44
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,510
and I'm has given you code that you can
use to control your helicopter

45
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,519
I have another version of this with
holes drilled in the back

46
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,820
with little wires running and so I could
try to figure out what was going on in

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,070
it

48
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,620
I'm now you don't need any that
somebody's reverse-engineered offer its

49
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,160
amazing

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,910
so helicopters helicopter is a fan

51
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,419
that is powerful enough to blow itself
into the air

52
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,709
right like like literally it is a fan

53
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,750
it blow straight down and it pushes
itself and potentially other things

54
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,400
up into the air um this 1i believe this
is a skyhook

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,000
I look up the specs it can pull up
twenty thousand pounds have stuff

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,359
not just itself 20,000 additional pounds
this is a fan that they can blow itself

57
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:29,940
and five or six SUV's into the air right

58
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,570
this is this is hysterical like the fact
these exist is just like

59
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,790
amazing so are nice little

60
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,919
Simon as 47 G twenty dollars buy it now
at Amazon

61
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,510
or you know from where you are but was
in 20 bucks earthly so this thing

62
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,930
has this concept up throttle so

63
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,859
you know how hard are you gonna push
down is a number from 0 to 127

64
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:55,260
I give you feeling here forty will spin
enough that

65
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,479
you might like go little out and bruise
your fingers sticking in there

66
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:04,440
I most have mine will hover in the upper
sixties lower 70's I think it depends on

67
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,590
just you know I mean it's less than 20
bucks so you know the build quality

68
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,850
varies a little bit

69
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,650
a battery lives very little bit there
lots going on there but so like

70
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,750
you know you're gonna hover in like
upper 60's or 70's generally

71
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,859
arm 127 is gonna augured into your
ceiling

72
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,660
I am so you know you kinda got the
throttle the play with once you get it

73
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,490
that downdraft I think I got a downdraft
here anyway so you get the throttle

74
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,900
0 to 127 makes a helicopter go up

75
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,960
if you turn it high enough Heights OH

76
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,139
I'm anybody remember conservation of
angular momentum

77
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:42,740
%ah haha okay I taught high school
physics and makes me really sad

78
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,090
on so I I guess I'll give you the
totally intuitive way to think about

79
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,840
this

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,830
so you're in mid-air and a helicopter
and you have a giant engine

81
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,099
and he starts spinning this rotor around
above your head

82
00:04:54,099 --> 00:05:00,870
really fast what keeps you from spinning
in the opposite direction

83
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,240
Haxey I this is the second time in a
stock and I've given as

84
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,409
that's like a you know it's like to run
out there knows but say the tail rotor

85
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:09,509
and then some egos tell rotor yes

86
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,180
that thing on the back who I can do it
my point ever got that thing on the back

87
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,669
there

88
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,539
that actually blows sideways and keeps
the bottom the helicopter from spinning

89
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:21,870
right just like I considered hysterical
that these things work at all

90
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,729
I'm so this is the sign-in and

91
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,819
this is the first pictures in its kinda
cozy artist too big rotors on a top

92
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,469
actually spin in opposite directions
look at the shape the blades I think a

93
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:36,860
the top ones clockwise in the bar bottom
one is counterclockwise

94
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,460
and so they spin in opposite directions
and make cut they counteract each

95
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,909
other's angular momentum

96
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,349
and keep your helicopter kind of
pointing forwards right

97
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,509
so there's 8 little dial on the bottom
assists it's the trim

98
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:52,969
and it's basically trying to adjust if
there's little speed differences between

99
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:54,479
the top and the bottom

100
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,340
so you can adjust the trim manually to
find the exact center

101
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,409
or arm what I like to do because I have
complete control over this is i

102
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:03,530
effectively

103
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,979
jam one stick on Wearside an attribute
turn the trim on whether one side

104
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,009
and I can do turns sharper than I can

105
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:14,129
from actually using the control directly
which is pretty nifty

106
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:17,389
so I'm that idea this this like back and
forth

107
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:20,699
that ID attorneys called ewe if you
shake your head no

108
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,960
your yawning your head alright so ya is
this turn back and forth so did you keep

109
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,659
yourself flat picture rotating like a
lazy susan

110
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:34,189
that is yaw so ya goes from 0 to 127
trim goes from 0 to 127 and sixty-three

111
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:34,979
the middle

112
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,419
263 means pretty much go forward I guess
said

113
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,479
wasn't my box 63 means pretty much go
forward

114
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,610
arm 0 I think means right one price
Hermes left I remember their

115
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,139
their conscience I get 'em summer I'm

116
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,249
next up tool tailored missile thing it
does happen tailback there

117
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:57,889
it is AL is yet another fan but it is
pointed the wrong way

118
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:02,120
right like snot points I was like on a
real helicopter it's pointed up

119
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,050
this is for the with called pitch
pitches another kinda rotation 6 shake

120
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,590
your head

121
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,419
yes let's pitch but with the the
rotation at left his role which is this

122
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:12,069
way

123
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:15,919
and our helicopter does not to roll it's
been a 10 bucks for that

124
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,949
so pitch pitch is this nodding her head
yes

125
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:23,639
this is pitch and so if we if you think
about it if we're

126
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,879
if a blow to little fan way out and I'll
ever like that we're gonna took the

127
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,560
helicopter forwards

128
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,050
right and what happens when we took a
helicopter ford's the giant blade from

129
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,969
atop are now pointing forward to drag
the entire thing for words

130
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:39,180
right if we want to go backwards what we
do we blow the air

131
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,319
up we tilted back in the entire thing
was backwards

132
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
so this gives us enough control to be
able to move this thing in three

133
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,080
dimensions

134
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,460
right me go up and down we can turn it
we can go forward and backwards

135
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,639
right there's some other motions we
can't do but we get pretty close

136
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
so pitch also runs 0 to 127

137
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,900
pitch is it important to note that 63 is
of

138
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,249
because if your pitch is not set to of

139
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:06,219
you say all this at the pitch 20 that
means turn a little fan on in the back

140
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,789
as fast as you can go

141
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:10,900
in one direction or the other right so
it's important in general

142
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,680
I'm I have stuck my fingers into the
plate service

143
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,029
book at first on purpose to make sure
didn't hurt that much and then by

144
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:20,669
accident many many other times enough

145
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,439
you might get some bruises you might be
really mad

146
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:29,749
but so I so I'm the little preparing the
back there was fragile

147
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:33,659
and I'm I don't wanna like totally freak
out my dog

148
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,710
so I'm make sure when you re setting
stuff you wanna set the pitch back to 63

149
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,409
you want that the fail-safe

150
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,589
10 not have thing spinning on your toy

151
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,589
when you think it stopped thats had
important

152
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,260
on the infrared protocols really easy
there's four bytes one for each setting

153
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,399
I basically just flashes an infrared LED

154
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,380
on little 10 no second 10 microseconds
yet here we go ten microsecond pulses

155
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,560
and then there's positive to in the
polls as the sender is a once and stuff

156
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,300
arm it's actually very very
straightforward and like I said

157
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,490
something else wrote the code for us

158
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,339
so its cool actor helicopters are
awesome money set them aside I want to

159
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,310
talk about are tweeners

160
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,329
this is the eighty mega 320 a chip I'm

161
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:17,690
it hasn't a bit processor I it has I
think 15

162
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,230
digital input/output pins get some like
six arm

163
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,279
analog input/output pins you can use to
sing to turn like you can turn off the

164
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,329
electricity

165
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:30,290
and turn on the electricity or read in a
readout electricity on a bunch these

166
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,089
pins

167
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:35,480
from software it allows you to interact
with the real world very simply

168
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,970
I'm it has 32 kilobytes a flash

169
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,170
it has an awesome easy prompt some RAM

170
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,250
this is an entire computer I'm

171
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,820
not that much less powerful then the
Commodore 64 I started out on

172
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,230
I'm in a chip that you can buy for like
three bucks

173
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,459
I don't like my dad by 10 at them to get
them at three bucks a piece

174
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,199
but this is like this tiny cheap little
embedded controller that you can stick

175
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:07,089
anything and they are awesome and
amazing they're they're very very very

176
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:07,779
low

177
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:12,160
capability but they're so much better
than trying to figure out

178
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,910
electronics I like all that other stuff
to do it all by hand

179
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,350
they're amazing but the problem with
embedded development

180
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,070
is usually get to write the code in C
and the need to cross compile it and

181
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,670
then you this whole thing to upload it
and send it over

182
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,259
and is this enormous pain and he spent
like 700 dollars on the stupid

183
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,209
development kit

184
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:34,930
and it's just this frustrating messy
thing a group of people

185
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,630
Italy I have this open source hardware

186
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,199
the Arduino and the art we know to know
which is kinda like the main art we know

187
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,199
we're talking about that uses 80 mega

188
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:49,490
320 a chip that one is less than 30
bucks on Amazon I'm sorry is an Amazon

189
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,620
for everything but

190
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,769
I hit the button and it shows up on

191
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,940
so the its 30 bucks on Amazon and they
give you

192
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,050
this entire development environment that
you can use it to you

193
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,089
embedded development on so if you look
at it you can see this this blog right

194
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:04,769
here

195
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:08,199
that's the eighty mega chip that's it
right there that's most up what an

196
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,170
Arduino is an art we know is just

197
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,339
some support stuff for that chip a

198
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,279
top left corner there's a little red
reset button I have it set up so i hit

199
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,300
the reset button

200
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,329
the helicopter stops are right below it
that's a USB plug

201
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:25,910
and then down the bottom is a power plug
a river plug in the power kazakh a

202
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,310
runoff USB that's what it's doing right
now it's

203
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,699
lights are flashing its running of the
USB power I'm good

204
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,410
I'm super simple straightforward you
talked it over the USB

205
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,399
they have solved all the problems for
you except are matching up like cross

206
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,329
compile C

207
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:43,420
and then you have to do of the senate
cross they've written a

208
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,649
I T and I D E for you it's not

209
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:51,360
the most impressive feature rich ID it's
aimed at beginners

210
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,410
and you're writing in this weird kind of
see you can see little hints have some

211
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,889
ways written some javascript before this
as well

212
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:03,569
arm but it feels very see like and the
best feature is right up here we see

213
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:04,009
that little

214
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:08,480
a row you hit the arrow it compiles the
code it sends it over to the Arduino for

215
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,220
you

216
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,819
resets it and your coaches starts
running that's it

217
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:16,269
I'm so it's taken just massive amounts
of pain

218
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:21,800
and effort and unhappiness and it's made
into something that I can

219
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,050
hand to my 12 year old cousin and kind
of poke and prod him a little bit and

220
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,089
have been doing real stuff

221
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:30,259
so when people talk about embedded
development there's a hello world for

222
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,569
the embedded

223
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:36,339
world a deer well you can't see it cuz I
made it really dark

224
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,509
but yeah there's a type they're seeking
to declare types it feels like see

225
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:45,029
so we're gonna make i leda were gonna
say thirty most Arduino boards have

226
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:50,420
an LED on pay him $13 for you are ready
to as a buncha pins you can turn on/off

227
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,240
pin 13 already has an LED on the board
like I said mines working away furiously

228
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,399
and others couple magic function names
such as it's called

229
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,970
so when they are tweeners reset the
setup function gets called

230
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,410
just automatically and work on the spin
mode function

231
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,730
they were basically saying I want pin 13
to be output

232
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,089
this means I'm gonna take him 13 I'm
gonna turn it on and I'm gonna turn it

233
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:14,290
off

234
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,350
you can all sit input I'm gonna see if
there's electricity they're not but

235
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,060
we're gonna set pin 13 output

236
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,449
we don't have this loop Guadalupe is
gonna do

237
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,810
his is gonna write out to pin 13 says
pin 13

238
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,940
hi that means may collect electricity
come out of it that's what that means

239
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,319
soap in thirteen have electricity come
out a bit way to 1000 milliseconds

240
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:40,019
so wait a second 1013 go low

241
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,579
shut it off way two thousand of seconds

242
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:46,630
and that's it so this loop function will
be called

243
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,350
and then once it exits it'll be called
again so you just read a simple little

244
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,339
loop function you don't need to do an
infinite loop yourself

245
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:55,879
and so this will function is called over
and over again in this is the hello

246
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,480
world it blinks a light on

247
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,600
it turns off points light on it turns it
off

248
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,690
I'm and it's kind of awesome cuz you're
making stuff

249
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,699
in the real world blink I'll be honest
right so

250
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:11,079
there's a problem though I wanna write
Python I am

251
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:15,800
I don't like thinking and see I wanna
think in Python I want the real cost of

252
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,279
on real processors arm and so

253
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,709
this is the solution I am I heard a
laugh

254
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,009
so yes though those of us who've been
doing this for a while recognize a db9

255
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:26,970
port

256
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,540
I am which is how we always the plugin r
1200 baud modems

257
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,050
I am and sometimes three her by Monday
guess but so this is ace

258
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,750
this is what serial ports used to look
like this is a very very basic

259
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,779
extraction of talking to something

260
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,860
you basically have two wires I push
bites that you might push bits

261
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,970
you actually so but I can't read data
stream bites I send bites the you you

262
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,610
can send bites back to me

263
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,579
were the wonderful things about the
eighty mega chip it had is it has a

264
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:54,000
built-in serial port

265
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,170
and one other wonderful things about the
Arduino Uno

266
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,829
is id will turn that serial port into a
serial port that shows up

267
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,209
on your laptop so you can just talk over
the serial port yard we now

268
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:08,680
and have your art we no talk back to
your papon program

269
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,730
and all the sudden you're you're
communicating we started shipping

270
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,980
like on my god we've architecture anyway

271
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,329
I'm this is a little bit of a rewrite

272
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:22,230
above that a that hello world example
what's can we get the

273
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,560
LED 13 we're gonna goes blank line 13
I'm

274
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,440
with senator output but this time we're
adding a serial begin 9600 so we're

275
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,360
gonna listen at 9600 baud

276
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,639
arm don't worry about that means a in
the down here

277
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,110
we've got this serial event this gets
called every time things come in

278
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,899
over the cereal I'm in a serial liar
that we're just gonna read in a bite

279
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,990
if that bite 0

280
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:51,310
we turn it off if that bite is one

281
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,720
we turn it on right to these are the
exact same things you're doing before to

282
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,240
before we had to sleep in return is
infinite loop

283
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,170
now we're doing it but we're doing it
based on things that are coming in over

284
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:01,980
the serial I'd

285
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,480
reading in bytes we're turning the light
on and off

286
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,050
and then down here the loop just delays
it just leads for a second so it's not

287
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,680
in a

288
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,680
too fast spin simple enough right this
is very sorry for code

289
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,399
I'm so then what's the pipe on half look
like

290
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,610
pip install pie serial

291
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,740
and then you can import cereal and
create a serial object

292
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,980
I'm that's what a serial ports path
looks like in Linux or Mac

293
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,319
in Windows its you up to like com nine
or something

294
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,569
I'm sayin 9600 baud and then I have an
infinite loop

295
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:39,230
I write a bite which is one I sleep for
a second

296
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:44,029
I read by which is zero asleep for a
second so I have to Sri implemented that

297
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:45,769
hello world flashing

298
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,160
light paying except I've put half the
code

299
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,079
on the Arduino and I have moved when I'm
starting to think about the business

300
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:53,939
logic

301
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:57,019
I've slip that over into the pipeline
right

302
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,230
so now comes the fun part hardware

303
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,810
so I this is my attempt at doing a
schematic the

304
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,459
there are a million tutorials out there
about how to blink lights from yard we

305
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,010
now

306
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,410
I'm look at them occurs their stuff you
gonna do about making sure you're using

307
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,160
the right resistor and

308
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,340
you get a good online calculators and
put in details about your LED and stuff

309
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,710
but it's also report

310
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,360
arm for singing to you by Wendys you
feel like a real electronics hobbyist

311
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,630
this is called a breadboard and you can
plug wires into it

312
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,600
and I am like I said feel like a real
Electronix hobbyist I have like three

313
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,730
things plug into mine

314
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,110
but it feels so much more real um

315
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,510
you need wire this is this is this is
not as obvious as you think

316
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,320
you don't want to stop a lot a little
little wires inside you want the solid

317
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,240
core stuff

318
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,240
because then it easier to plug into the
art we know and the

319
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,250
as well as the breadboard I'm

320
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,990
you can buy resistors for like the one
you need in like a five pack for like

321
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,300
four dollars or something or you can
spend twelve dollars and they will

322
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,000
ship you a couple hundred resistors you
get all the fun of sorting through a try

323
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,670
to figure out what all those little
stripes mean

324
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,220
on which once again I'm just into this
to feel like an electronics hobbyist

325
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,590
a so I was all too that I'm gonna find
anyone the suckers

326
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,350
this is an infrared LED you can actually
see it blinking

327
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:20,080
which is pretty awkward arm but if you
look at your cell phone your cell phone

328
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,060
will pick it up and you can see it
blinking faintly in your cell phone

329
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,130
which is really nifty

330
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,460
um I bought this my local radio shack
I'm

331
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,670
if you still have a local radio shack
you can try that I am

332
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,110
otherwise I found a bunch on Amazon look
like they were good enough I've also

333
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,540
been thinking about cutting out

334
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,130
the ones that are in this cuz I have
enough for these controllers at this

335
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,990
point

336
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,570
I'm so this is the start of our code to

337
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,970
controlled helicopter I we're gonna set
up an array with

338
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,400
ya pitch throttle trim I'm a few in
paying attention you'll notice those are

339
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,920
the safe

340
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,290
values those are the stop moving values
which I want to release stress is a good

341
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,140
idea

342
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,860
arm when things initializing you're
dealing with things in the real world

343
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,320
in general you want things to be turned
off I'm just sayin

344
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,220
arm I actually did some work for friend
then he you

345
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,030
accidentally would flash everything on
and then turn it off as part of his

346
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,920
initialization

347
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,130
which was not really no support we
hooked up to like

348
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:19,660
relays and stuff that moved in then it
became a real big issue

349
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,240
so you wanna with stuff initializes
everything should be turned

350
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,890
of art so then in the set up we're gonna
say

351
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,520
the pin mode we're gonna say up we're
gonna be doing output the way I hope my

352
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,730
LED up bike

353
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,800
make it go high in order to turn off
whatever

354
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,330
on like that reason tutorials about
flashing LED's I'm

355
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,440
and then we do a serial begin 9600 by
once again we're gonna be

356
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,610
we're gonna be listening on serial port
I'm this is not exactly the most robust

357
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,770
coat but it

358
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,070
works arm I have a up slightly

359
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,040
longer production version is that
actually does like some check some stuff

360
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,520
but

361
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,680
whatever so if his there's four things
available

362
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,840
if we can grab for things out a serial
officer line

363
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,080
was just copy them into the commands

364
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,420
so that a rate that we just initialize
will copy those values in just

365
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,000
verbatim I'm and that's it

366
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,530
so that over here there's the send
packet thing which brings the LED's

367
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,660
I'm its like you blink 74 times to get
the helicopters attention and then you

368
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,310
wait

369
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:24,290
688 no seconds for one at like 415 all
second 30 or something

370
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,760
whatever it it flashes away this is good
stuff to write

371
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,800
in the Arduino code because it depends
on microsecond precision to do all that

372
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,020
and you bring the LED's in your turn a
time to sleep at the end of this

373
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,880
so you're you're breaking away and then
it says are you know i i wanna sleep for

374
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,900
you know

375
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,060
three hundred milliseconds or whatever
it does and so that in a loop

376
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,170
we send the command and we sleep until
the next time is set to commence again

377
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,910
and that's it that's that's I mean
there's you know there's like 2013 lines

378
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,000
in here but this is it

379
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,160
this is sufficient control helicopter
from their tween aside

380
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,450
was a python side look like well I we
have a helicopter object

381
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,080
I have a path I am this is me being lazy
and not wanting to hard code

382
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,190
I guess it's not lazy one heart Cody in
the TTY

383
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,410
USB 14.11 ever so I search for it I set
up a serial port

384
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,130
I V of pitch throttle and trim
attributes

385
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,930
and then I have a send function which
builds up a little message

386
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,530
writes the message out washes it and
then print it out to the strains I can

387
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,510
see it

388
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,430
that's it that is sufficient code to
control the helicopter from Python

389
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,480
cell I do at some belts and suspenders

390
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,990
I am because I you know I where both
belt and suspenders to keep my pants up

391
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,520
right

392
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,060
so I'm when I'm done with stuff that
moves I like to have as many things I

393
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,760
can hit

394
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,940
or press or freak out about to stop
stuff moving as I possibly can

395
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,750
I'm so in this case I just three times I
write out stop inflation sleep and 96

396
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,210
exit

397
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,030
and is hoping bomb out and stop sending
commands that so

398
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,570
wanna my thanks to mr. im in practice I
tend to hit the big red but more often

399
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,320
right so level 1 I think this is level 1
what is level 1 level one is

400
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,090
this is a 3d turtle that can take your
eye out

401
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,370
so this is a takeoff function we're
gonna set the ya pitch in

402
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,430
and tram of sixty three separate things
in the center we set the problem of

403
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:20,300
240 we send that and we sleep for five
seconds so we just said

404
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,400
put everything in neutral cracked the
throttle up a little bit sit there for

405
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,440
five seconds

406
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,180
the point in this is the helicopter
knees to sink up with the commands from

407
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,890
the infrared for a little bit

408
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,600
so your it'll be you'll be like that's
not working at all

409
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,990
Daniel for your finger will be there I
am so so this is thought this is time to

410
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,900
to whack your finger take your finger
out and then after supper 5 seconds

411
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,090
he said the problem ninety which is arm
climb

412
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,580
but don't hit the ceiling for me at
least I and he said that in any sleep

413
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,000
for 2nd circuit a little bit about

414
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,080
up and then you set the trial 68 this is
magic

415
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,730
I'm this was one of my helicopters I
don't think I actually another outlet

416
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,570
like two identical ones that look like
this are not but this one or the other

417
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,020
one

418
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,360
but for one of them 68 is the in still
air

419
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,710
kinda popper iraq so

420
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,160
he said that and I we now have a
function we can call

421
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,450
that basically causes a helicopter
takeoff so here's a final program

422
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,800
we create the helicopter object we talk
to take off we set the yada 0

423
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,510
so yeah I is this way so this means
basically take a hard

424
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:31,030
right I believe we set the pitch to 50
which is titled back slightly

425
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,540
we send thats are basically saying spin
backwards

426
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,410
for just the for a lil you know and for
a 10 seconds

427
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,840
and then we sail and which if you're a
member resets everything in crashes on

428
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,630
the program

429
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,320
okay so as can level one very basic

430
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,280
superfine your typing things that I
papon prompt and stuff is moving

431
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,130
arm and it's great so level two

432
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:00,060
this is what I do with everything are we
make web API so

433
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,340
from this is a complete flask ap I
believe

434
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,430
that provides a Web API and you can post

435
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:11,530
ya pitch throttling trim values to it I
am it reads them and from you know the

436
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,970
request and then it goes in set/sets
ESPN on helicopter in that sense it a

437
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,660
helicopter

438
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,420
and returns the helicopter what the
helicopters guys have been sector

439
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,660
I am so yeah that works

440
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,190
you now taken this toy helicopter and
you've made it available over the

441
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,680
Internet

442
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,000
I did this for the drumset want
something magical I am

443
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,510
alright so then level 3 this is my most
my Saturday mornings for the past

444
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,670
couple months I'm if you see the little
dot at actually me

445
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,220
finding LED I told to the blinking LED
was useful

446
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,470
finding the blinking LED with open CV
are some trying to track the helicopter

447
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,150
so I use open CV to fire a guy get the
video capture object at the tracker

448
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,220
is by the way the only need part my code
the code inside I'm

449
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,380
the code inside the trackers is pretty
disgusting

450
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,920
arm but so I try to handle its frame I
grab a sequence is a images of have

451
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,930
webcam

452
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,900
I tracked LED on the front and a
helicopter and then I'm trying to crack

453
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,170
for drift and hold it still

454
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:19,630
on there are much easier where his to
control helicopter make it hold still

455
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,640
by I wanted to play with open CV and P
ID loops and industrial control

456
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,990
technologies and stuff

457
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,080
I'm I've seen people do things like this
with a.m.

458
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,470
x-box connect and get much better result
much less effort

459
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,410
I'm but I but I'm having more fun I am
so

460
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,220
this calls of course for a live demo I
was actually told if I don't have a

461
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,150
helicopter flying over the audience

462
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,490
I failed so um will see what I can do
for you

463
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,090
I'm I also asked my like like I know a
couple people front row and Mike

464
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,250
get ready to catch this I so

465
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,950
of course I wrote a little Ajax thing

466
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,300
I am and i'ma see here

467
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,790
yeah come on ok great see I was up here
before and I was working fine

468
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,380
turn off again yes that that does make a
difference sometimes

469
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,520
sure

470
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,510
German however you

471
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,340
sana crank the crack at most the way
well II

472
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,830
and year

473
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,860
I so I

474
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,210
via the LED I got has a waco

475
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,650
30-degree angle so I have this car loan
I can fly an

476
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,700
and you all sorts of the edges account
that 1i safety features the aircraft is

477
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,150
it drops out the sky

478
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,930
when you're not saying it commands
anymore I'm so

479
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:54,130
world think so I really want to stress
about all this

480
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,570
is that its almost all just software I'm

481
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,680
you're making things move in the real
world but you're controlling of from

482
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,530
software

483
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:06,370
and the feeling you get the first time
you typed commands

484
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,010
at a command prompt and physical stuff
actually moves

485
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:15,750
is amazing I'm if you have kids you're
trying to get interested in programming

486
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,070
get them playing with an Arduino and
moving things as just it's just magical

487
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,160
like to giggle fits that happen

488
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,990
I'm you know one wonders if this
helicopter is like i said i bruised my

489
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,590
fingers

490
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,050
I'm but it's it's not that dangerous I'm

491
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,960
it now just noise my dog on but

492
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,960
point I'm trying to make is this is
software you can mess around with this

493
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,520
you can play with us you can do all
sorts of wonderful things

494
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,100
and you should do so are many should
help those around you do so

495
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,200
I and I've got wings on my blog in jail
but US we can buy all the stuff

496
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,020
and do it iraq thank you very much money
was a Jackson lovely

497
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,930
mejía on Twitter's what's up on in jail
.us

498
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,100
and time for questions one question

499
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,600
one question no questions

500
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:11,600
alright how ok a question question

501
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:17,220
II do II UN UN

502
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,290
on so salata magic values but then you
also showed that

503
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:26,590
you know you're using in computer vision
to controlled reference up

504
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,960
so whenever you build a new helicopter I
mean each jessica's cuts made it was

505
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,920
gonna have it so much

506
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,230
values yep have you tried to use

507
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,180
generation to basically set those values
they just left fly and then set the

508
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,420
values for that particular

509
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,910
that's what I've that's what I've been
trying to do but they are so I'm

510
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,710
like a little breeze will cause them to
to start going wild

511
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,410
so it's pretty hard I've been trying to
do a Pido perdon I mean you can like

512
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,940
machine learned about his for PI

513
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,030
the loop and I've been failing miserably
at that but having a wonderful time

514
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,730
I have Ubuntu scratches my computer
screen actually arm from

515
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,320
from trying to fly it between me and my
laptop and then things going horribly

516
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,790
awry

517
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,420
which has been fun and dude okay one
more

518
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,610
okay arm so we have way too many these
helicopters

519
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,870
my office and we also no such thing ap

520
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,900
and we also starting something like
thirty dollar quadcopter

521
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,930
YES on juneau protocol

522
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,770
weird I have I spent so much time
googling

523
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,300
and the river set so the question is
have other protocols in reverse

524
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,880
engineered

525
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,550
I'm Simon makes this whole like giant
Ranger these things

526
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,560
there's a bunch of other are
manufactured in China gorgeous churning

527
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,260
out clones and variations and

528
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,410
copies I'm I found at the reverse
engineering at this I found it on like

529
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,710
some message board

530
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,640
like two years ago from some guy who
lectured appointed hey look what I did

531
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,960
in like 10 way

532
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,990
so I V its what are these have been done
there's lotsa stuff out there

533
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,510
arm and I just not a comparable in size
or scope

534
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,340
so I just 11 diagnosed in reverse
engineered but if you go around as a

535
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,760
bunch other ones out there

536
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,790
i kno cuz I tried several them wondering
if they were the right ones for this

537
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,630
helicopter actually

538
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,260
some thank you you're welcome thank you
very much everybody
