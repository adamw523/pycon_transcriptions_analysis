br/ and tweet about it because

5
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:24,250
it's amazing to see this many people
just as confused about DNS as I am

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,009
and am

7
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,339

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,910
I'm so as it nerdy

23

person who likes to jet away to Lake

24
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,450
I don't know a hotel like an hour away
do you still like hacking over a long

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,980
weekend trying to like

26
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,120
deploy a sun-like cool app a always seem
to like

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,409
messed it up great like a simple like
get pushed to her okay like

28
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,740
doesn't work on who's ever had that
issue

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,110
China like to play something simple get
pushed

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,670
yeah from can see it yeah okay I see a
lot of hands um

31
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,320
and I'm sure you recognize this on it's
always like a DNS issue when you're

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,180
trying to

33
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,450
on China deploy your app on and I'm sure

34
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,530
not a few here have had like clean at
DNS setup the first time around

35
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,399
otherwise

36
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,170
you would not be here who has had a very
clean set up a DSLR like first time

37
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,560
around

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,650
now okay up one person

39
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,469
I don't know why you hear the music at
the time I'm

40
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:24,920
so I'm yes they follow the instructions
and

41
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,969
probably set the DNS records in the %uh
something doesn't work

42
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,889
and we've all been there and so without
a solid understanding at DNS

43
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:37,870
in sometimes a folks just like I'll just
try this now disliked week this record

44
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,680
or some like that

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,799
waiting for DNS to propagate to see an
if your guess was correct

46
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:47,650
so hopefully this presentation will give
you a better understanding

47
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,719
am curiosity got the best in me when I
was

48
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,730
get pushed China Plain and it didn't
work i want to sale

49
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,870
dive deeper into a DNS is I'm not so I'm

50
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,269
a new their DNS was like answer the
phone book

51
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:06,169
and the back onto the internet but on I
also knew that the cloud

52
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,659
spilled on DNS and duct tape and DNS
itself is

53
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,819
pretty much duct tape together so well
it is confusing and

54
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,480
has Lake and a text books or definition
but

55
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,909
it doesn't always work the way we think
it does I'm so what exactly be going

56
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:23,769
over is

57
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,430
am what DNS is and why you should care

58
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,989
about DNS and what's to do with it what
to do

59
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,209
with the NS as well as like are some
things I learned along the way

60
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,590
so first I wanna explain like why DNS is
put it important

61
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,809
and it allows you to visit very
productive web sites like Reddit

62
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:49,519
it allows you to like to see very time
critical emails like Groupon

63
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,279
her guilt and deploy or whatever kind to
do up on her okay room

64
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:57,459
and I'm that allows you to them

65
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:01,319
for your corporate mean generator to not
be accessible by non-employees

66
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,339
I'm still we know that

67
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:08,790
the DNS is essentially the phone but it
stands for a domain name system

68
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,879
and translates from human readable names
to computer family

69
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,500
addresses but the actual like textbook
definition

70
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,430
set DNS is it distributed storage system
for resource records

71
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,540
on each your DNS resolver or

72
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,930
authoritative server: stores these
records and its cash or

73
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,759
opal's owned by on the record music
contains a label a class type in some

74
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,270
data

75
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,270
so that might be a text but but

76
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,580
that still like you're a parade I kind
of like

77
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,889
sorry kinda behind i cud still doesn't
make sense on

78
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:48,639
you get up but you don't actually get so
let's actually see it CDNs

79
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,259
in action so commoner to understand the
NS

80
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,599
I was playing with and Python for sale
used

81
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:00,020
landscape be to sniff some DNS traffic
and to browse like

82
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,569
the interwebz so I'm using ski be
dismissed like scabies the function

83
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:08,069
and to pick up my local traffic as you
can see I've

84
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,110
filtered my traffic via UTPA and

85
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,689
import 53 just to hone in on DNS traffic

86
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,729
on and i've only limited to like 10
packets

87
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:21,849
cell as I let this sniff function run

88
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:26,590
and I want to type in my browser
Rogaland outcome which is my website

89
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,349
locally see it I'm so was pretty cool

90
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:34,259
is an as an at that I found they can
kinda see here is

91
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,460
I was typing robe lynda.com into the
CMake chrome

92
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,879
address bar and a DNS query would take
place for every

93
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,139
autocomplete guess that chrome to so
first

94
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:48,680
it pings a they will not calm because
the address

95
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,860
is also search function right

96
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,009
and then as a tape are a complete to
read it

97
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:59,729
because I can't go there very often and
nominee can actually see the DNS query

98
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:00,349
on

99
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:04,379
on the second line for for bed and then
as I type are

100
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,030
0 and prom dresses are broken dust by

101
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,770
I'm which is and my super awesome how to
style a python presentation that you

102
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,280
should check out

103
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,500
on and then and we can see and it's its
related query that it

104
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,560
points Tim on the election define

105
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,180
and then on it finds Aeroplan dot com
want I type

106
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,770
Roog and press Enter with the crumbs and
our position

107
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,889
like I guess it's more purple thing
about from the Nespresso things pretty

108
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:34,830
calm

109
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,050
on but one thing that you might notice
here and in

110
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,069
not sure if you can really see it an but
all these DS prairies have

111
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,250
a dot at the end and I'm sure but many
have you

112
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,659
know it's like just how DNS does things

113
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:54,919
but and is anyone know like why it's
there raisins

114
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,889
get like 3 okay get your own right place

115
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,219
am so the difference between a dot in a
no dot

116
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:07,800
an is this is same difference between
absolute file path and relative file

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,240
path

118
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,530
so on like bill to file cuz it can be an

119
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:18,349
them like this dot dot such data can be
mangled are mapped incorrectly

120
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:21,590
cell and depending upon how your local
DNS

121
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,770
is set up if you have search and

122
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,830
example dotnet in years all dot com and
you navigate to

123
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,400
example dot com a DNS surgery will take
the year old not to be fully qualified

124
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,810
I'm

125
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,499
and therefor will look up example dot
com dot example dotnet

126
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,680
dot or whatever on and

127
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,330
so and you can see that I am if I
actually

128
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,509
search for example dot com dot Hill go
to double dot com not that

129
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,979
example that con got example dotnet I'm
so if there's a dot at the

130
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:58,590
and minutes and unambiguous fully
qualified domain name

131
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,060
and it's not prone to the search path
spoofing

132
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,279
um no I didn't put a dot well navigating
to

133
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,349
pro-clinton am but putting a dot is not
exactly

134
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:11,930
user friendly when you're trying to like
type in something so chrome kinda have

135
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,840
inherently

136
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,219
am assumes a dot

137
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:20,650
so I'm handling all this DNS stuff
father's death carrying stuff kinda got

138
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,180
me curious

139
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,580
you know as one is IOM and I want to
figure out what route leading as curry

140
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,909
takes to file I get an answer

141
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:32,090
for where Roque lyn is hosted in as not
actually that

142
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,740
easy to figure out once again as pre
hits the router

143
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,430
to better the black box an and that the
query is forwarded to you

144
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,650
if it's not locally cached I know that
my computers DNS

145
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,520
is set up to one are 192 die 168 at 11

146
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,660
in which is my router and my router's
DNS is set up to study but that's only

147
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,850
5.7 5.7 5

148
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,690
um in I found this out by actually doing
a logging into the admin page at my

149
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,060
router

150
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,430
so I do a host query for my for the

151
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,990
routers DNS I can see that there is a
pointer to

152
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,190
Comcast dotnet subdomain

153
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,010
now if I do and who is clearly on that
ipsa a Comcast my ISP and provider

154
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,180
actually owns

155
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,610
and the IP address but beyond that I do
not know if Comcast DNS Hasbro glenda

156
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,800
Comcast

157
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,010
and if not I don't know where it goes to
an

158
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,710
to get that information but DNS as some
you might know is

159
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,860
I'm hierarchical on an and getting
familiar with a dick man can let us

160
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,560
that can help us understand that serve
hierarchy in how queries are resolved

161
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,110
on dig it man actually has this nice
trace

162
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,570
flag that makes enters queries to
resolve the name being looked up

163
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,780
am it follows referrals from the root
servers

164
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,360
I'm showing the answer from each server
that is used that was used to look at

165
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,660
to do a reverse lookup Sophie try that
out with them

166
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,260
Python .org and you can see I use the
day communal apologize if it's

167
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,740
too small and aid to the day command
against Python .org with the

168
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,010
trace flag and I'm the kinda see it like

169
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,570
a buyer for the information but let's
let's look at it

170
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,250
them in a very prettier representation

171
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,520
so the query actually starts from

172
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,490
Maya local DNS 192 dot 168 that 1.1

173
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,770
where if not cached is passed onto

174
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,980
the fruit server which is just dot

175
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,700
and the curry from my local DNS for
Python org

176
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,800
first ass for the root server on the dot

177
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,410
who knows and that one of these hosts
should have that on the information

178
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,850
below those host there

179
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,020
and so the name server responds with Mia
go ahead try one is

180
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,450
which corresponds to a dot word name
server:

181
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,930
the dot org name server: receive the
query and then

182
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,630
says something like try one of these
hosts which corresponds to the Python

183
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,370
decor name server: and a paper and out
or get them

184
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,220
name services yep I haven't a record for
Python org which is one

185
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,400
42 11 1069

186
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,540
I'm sowwy sorry successively resolved

187
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,670
Python .org but you can see we have like

188
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,710
other like subdomains am if you want to
know more about say like

189
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,760
HG to Python .org am

190
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,850
began to take a man and we actually see
that it's a CNAME record

191
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,960
map to an an app to record that sound by
am

192
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,100
organ State University's open source lab
am which

193
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,150
is a different am which is a different
record also I'm

194
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,370
so now I'm sure that Python door cuz

195
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,990
on more records than just an ass and a
records

196
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,540
so if you're curious we can run the day
command with them the Dashti

197
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,210
any and many am unfortunately only see
it a records in NS records

198
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,100
but if we look at on pilot is dot com as
all the more interesting you can see

199
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,630
am SOA records pointing to name dot com
you can see

200
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,540
our mail records RMX records plane to
Google

201
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,930
an arm a records pointing to you our web
host

202
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,000
hmmm what you don't get is with any is
the full

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,360
on zone feiler the DNS setup like all

204
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,930
the sea names that are possible on an
obscenely

205
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,270
go into that all been few minutes

206
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,620
moving on am so we were easily to

207
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,830
we can easily see how a DNS like that
path takes for resolving

208
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,460
and by Thunderbird however it's not the
most efficient way and for DNS to

209
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,460
respond to queries

210
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,120
and the route and the top will name
servers like dot and I ordered

211
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,040
would be inundated with requests a free
for DNS resolvers always go to that

212
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,940
the start and so that's where I'm DNS
caching comes into play

213
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,220
so when a DNS resolver 30 did name
server receives

214
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,830
aquarium it searches its cash for an
achingly will

215
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,860
if there's no matching label in the cash
to serve remains said retrieved from its

216
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,610
cash

217
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,560
and a referral response containing
resource record set have

218
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,150
annus records for a label that might be
closer to the domain

219
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,470
which is the subject at the cream sunset
did

220
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,700
um to receiving her for a response a DNS
resolver can also be configured

221
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,180
to you and initiate an to initiate

222
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,340
them on

223
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,430
nursing curry for an authoritative a DNS
server room

224
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,920
responsible for the domain name an which
is

225
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,050
the sobriquet aquarium and the thirtieth
name so we can respond with an answer if

226
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,140
roller field response

227
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,650
and the thirtieth a.m. names a response
is accepted by

228
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,680
DNS resolver and then is subsequently
stored into

229
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,920
cash if it only needs a certain

230
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,270
conditions which is specific to the
resolvers implementation

231
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,540
so if my local DNS servers cash was
completely empty

232
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,860
am I could send it as carrie Ann for
Python that order to root server room

233
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,690
and then get pointed to go to the name
Syria handled or domain

234
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,840
but it's more likely that I have
something like dot already am sites

235
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,390
already cash so I can go straight to the
like the dot work sites

236
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,290
um and then it just kinda trickles down
from there

237
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,630
am SCO and DNS caching is all

238
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,190
you know great hunky-dory Intel you get
to propagation

239
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,960
her occasion is how long someone has to
wait for DNS changes to show a fact

240
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,670
am adidas record will hold an item
called TTL

241
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,830
on time to live number am which and

242
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,910
at which point it deleted if that time
the light is

243
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,930
up and so after its deleted I have
someone makes a new request that furs

244
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,730
refers to that record in on the DNS
server will go through that process

245
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,600
again a

246
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,710
trying to find that information

247
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,720
having and a tu hi time to live

248
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,990
that number an will it take longer for

249
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,130
for cash into flushing for your friend
said be able to go to your glory a

250
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,060
studio apt that's on her a VM

251
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,550
am having a tool 0 TTL am the set then a
server will be it

252
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,610
inundated with them a high-low damn

253
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,830
might not have the ability to deal with
her curry lamb

254
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,050
another pain have propagation

255
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:45,790
in NT TL is that some and Internet
service providers completely ignore

256
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:51,700
details and have their own comics expect
like expiry for records

257
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,250
I'm cashing actually opens up the
ability to

258
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,430
to poison a DNS cache is cash am

259
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,270
by for this is not my area of expertise
but as I understand it

260
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,800
DNS cache poisoning works like Sam am

261
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,890
if the server doesn't validate a DNS
response

262
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:14,130
like for instance via and in a sec am
someone could exploit that but I am

263
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,730
essentially spoofing and IP address that
he or she

264
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,060
owns forgiven hostname forcing users

265
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,280
that certain hostname to be directed
elsewhere

266
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,000
to be able to spook a DNS entry am an
attacker

267
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,780
would have to create a faster response
and then that a legitimate a 38-7

268
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,470
now you can and effectively and de dos

269
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,980
a DNS server are cashing survey with
probable

270
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,650
non-cash entries providing many attempts
to send fake responses

271
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,910
and those random demands that are now
cast aren't to use phone

272
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,130
but what an attacker can do is include a
name server in his or her response

273
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,720
for the desired remained to compromise

274
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,909
so on those are the band potential
issues with cashing in a lot of people

275
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:07,309
actually do face issues with publication

276
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:10,819
am when trying to like deploy on her ok
im

277
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,839
I'm bird on my kinda want to go into
like

278
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,860
that kinda cool dirty things they did
learn while exploring DNS

279
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,500
and maybe you will enjoy them as much as
I'd in

280
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,480
I'm so first up I'll start off with them
interesting ways to interact with TNS

281
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,190
am so previously and when doing a dig

282
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,910
any queries like an dick pie ladies
Dashti any

283
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,440
and the we know so we can I get any
CNAME records

284
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,430
and back like Debbie to be carried out
public is to come

285
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,470
and you can certainly run big angry
against Derby Derby Derby oppose dot com

286
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,920
but how many subdomains are there you
don't really down

287
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,310
and being able to look up a full DNS
zone file

288
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,540
I'm is barely allowed on but there's
this

289
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,980
am loses to all called DNS map that
literally brute force is

290
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,570
a sub domain lookup so I'm

291
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,850
China Deanna I'm trying to do in a snap
up I ladies

292
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:16,100
unfortunately I returns for results even
though I know that there's over 20 min

293
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,460
and so donuts like if your users don't
expect them

294
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,030
the results to be comprehensive or fast
since is clearly

295
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,660
searching base on adults and are
provided wordless

296
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,850
I'm so yeah this tool is limited by

297
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,200
worthless but you can supply on your own
like it much longer wordless

298
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,120
b1 am

299
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,060
am so when another thing they learned
dominos play around by Dennis

300
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,240
I want to figure out what was cashed
locally my own

301
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,820
and local DNS so am for

302
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,200
maximally say I'm not share for an when
its systems or a window systems

303
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,020
you in order to find out what is cached
locally

304
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,250
and you either have to kill the DNS
process and Senate to syslog

305
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,360
so after you run on this command of you
flush the cache

306
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,470
and you go into your spam system but log
on

307
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,050
am under system you can see some

308
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,400
familiar looking results I have a leech
and the cert actually looks kinda

309
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,470
descend on the slides but there's a lot
more information

310
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,730
am and interesting enough on all these

311
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,630
entries are were made from when I was
DNS mapping Spotify

312
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,780
so so it's pretty fun and if we and
actually look at

313
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,790
captured packet minnows I'm using scibi
to sniff traffic generated by Dennis

314
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,500
napping Spotify am

315
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,710
done dotnet and you can see an actually

316
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,530
a very top the internet lehrman the act
and then the IP layer in

317
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,690
which you can see it went from my
computer IP address to you my DNS route

318
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,200
I'm

319
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,140
and then it D and the DNS map was trying
to

320
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,140
trying out the Zr doubts but if I dot
net at the bottom

321
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,490
and so you can see that question record
that DNS will send

322
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,120
am so I think I am I think looking for
and through

323
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,970
escapee in sniffing and yes chapters is
pretty interesting

324
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,480
but I'm I'm hearing telepathically from
you guys a an

325
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,940
not enough Python so am

326
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,300
so here comes twisted I'm so you can
actually ran a

327
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,840
very simple a DNS server with Preston am

328
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,120
Paul does again if you if it's not that
read a bomb so this is a very

329
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,080
get very simple DNS server am is based
off for

330
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,710
ECT resolve dot com of but you can
supply on and DNS servers to take him

331
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,559
and so we can run this season as well as
fire apps KPN run

332
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:51,680
the day command against the server room
and many consider question

333
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,720
and down their nose digging for Python
.org on

334
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,120
has the crew name type in class and
again it goes from my eye

335
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,530
from my IP address my computer to my
router

336
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,160
and so here it is a response am with the
DNS

337
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,230
resource record in the data associated
with it

338
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,490
so if ur said that question and now this
is the actual response

339
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,850
it am went from my router to my computer
am

340
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,050
and you can see the resource record name
in the bottom with Python or the type

341
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,840
class TTL them and did assist you with
that

342
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,860
am alright so we'd Owen over interesting
ways to interact with the an ass now

343
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,610
some interesting ways to actually use
DNS

344
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,690
and some the am its me folks may know

345
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,770
the types of IP network addressing
methodology including

346
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,280
unique ass small dick ass broadcasts
anycast

347
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,910
is a fourth one where datagrams are sent
from

348
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,970
a single-center to a group have
potential return receivers

349
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,210
all identified by the same address
referred to as 12

350
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,990
nearest Association and so Google
actually uses any cast for its public

351
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,210
DNS servers the

352
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,700
8.8 8.8 and 8.8 up 4.4

353
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,280
where someone looking up an 8888

354
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,080
in Australia Australia may am go
somewhere different then if someone

355
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,970
on in the US where to go to and to look
up

356
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,200
8888 but they both received the same
information

357
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,190
to look Google configures alt
applications for anycast

358
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,530
now allows folks in like operations to
be able to take down like one cluster

359
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,590
a time in like reroute traffic to
another

360
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,680
there's no worry and that about folks
not getting

361
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,110
this the same data when looking at 8
a.m. insert it's quite nice for

362
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,309
for general accounting

363
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:53,290
and Dane am stands for DNS based
authentication have named entries

364
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,680
basically a protocol um for to the gets
to be bound to

365
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,570
DS names using and DNS security
extensions or heard in a sec

366
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,660
it's a basically a proposed way to
remove

367
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,059
and certificate authority for when at:
less client and server

368
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:14,620
authenticating so on and German many if
you're familiar with that lock icon on

369
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,770
your web browser im

370
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,800
but am are you sure

371
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,260
and that you're connecting all the way
to the website using correct

372
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,500
kill us certificate am it is

373
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,150
am quite possible and quite common for
like a firewall to get in between

374
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,300
and terminate your tillis in connection
with their website and then recreate the

375
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,940
kill us

376
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,290
connection from your device to your
browser am so you think that your secure

377
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,070
and

378
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,990
any havoc Inc a good connection to your
bank but in fact the connection to be

379
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,360
intercepted in the firewall or another
device

380
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,500
is able to see a potentially awkward all
interactions at the website

381
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,660
so if the browser supporting Dane on

382
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,050
the tax that it is not using a specific

383
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,580
are specified certificate Anakin warn
you that I am near

384
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,270
connection is and secure even though you
see that locked icon

385
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,460
and supposedly and the DNS Python
library has support for this already and

386
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,270
it's a development branch

387
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,309
another dinner Dino ghetto awesomeness
that I

388
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:21,660
and pepper but my deep dive into Python
herbs Pittman

389
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,760
DNS is and as they can be use for
service every

390
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,620
and there are few ways and tools to
implement service discovery but

391
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,520
ultimately boils down to

392
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,580
what servers run this service

393
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,590
as mention one can leverage DNS to help
answer this question

394
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,150
with the use the a ser B records

395
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,620
cell MSRB records are then DNS zones

396
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,990
map cannot claim step will be in the
format underscore

397
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,220
name underscore protocol as you see here

398
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,260
dot sight come to host names so for
instance

399
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,980
at Spotify is service has its own as RB
record in

400
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,200
with one record cannot be named after
the service itself

401
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,620
so and you spin up a Spotify client it
doesn't as Herbie lookup

402
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,620
similar to am that they commanded

403
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,200
and then the service look at continues
on

404
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,940
so Clank it connects to are a dozen SRB
look at it connects to an access point

405
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,190
and then continues resolving to the data
that's needed either to play this is

406
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,790
torture

407
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,130
or whatever

408
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:32,250
and lustful nugget much I think it might
be the coolest little nugget

409
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,140
on is the ability to store a DHT ring in

410
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,059
a DNS on DHT stands for distributed hash
table 9

411
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,100
adage T gives you a dictionary like
interface

412
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,500
are key value store I'm but the data or
the nodes are distributed

413
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,730
among the network Spotify I'm store some
updates

414
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,520
service configuration data with in
indiana spared %eh tearing

415
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,100
within a DNS TXT records I'm you may
have seen out here

416
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,120
and TXT records elsewhere I know that
Google App Engine

417
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,559
discern and Guinness mapping with TXT
records

418
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,200
so data from attic a particular Spotify
service

419
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,010
is hashed and is locked at some point am
on

420
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:21,360
ADHD rating and the servers in the ring
are responsible for certain segment

421
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,400
appearing in this case and since be

422
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,190
owns and keys and from a.m.

423
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,850
3 ass up into 14

424
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,730
and then and since eons from C you 12

425
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,790
and ninety its kinda counterclockwise
little bit confusing

426
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,940
but it's actually it's actually quite
cool to am

427
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:49,059
use DNS home in this list distributed
fashion

428
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:52,330
so am I A through um a lot love

429
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,470
DNS at you and dennis is by no means

430
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,250
easy to get into understand within like
a thirty minute talk

431
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,490
so I guarantee you you will and appear

432
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,440
do deployment configuration again
because and DNS is hard

433
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,710
but it's not the only way an but it's
not only hard to learn bit of hard to

434
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,250
make

435
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,800
could talk I was thinking like this talk
is gonna be crap it's actually DNS is

436
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,530
crappy

437
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,120
so some hopefully he'll take some

438
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,820
nearly awesomeness away from those
buying technology and I'm

439
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,370
yeah I hope you enjoyed the talk the
sides will be up soon and I'm

440
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:37,370
thank you

441
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,900
and now how much time we have through
bit

442
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,370
we have like a minute or two minutes if
them someone

443
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,520
well maybe I'll take one question or
maybe if you want a discussion we could

444
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:50,870
just

445
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,910
go outside the home does anyone have a
quick question maybe

446
00:27:53,910 --> 00:28:00,910
yeah you

447
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,370
I'm I think pretty hard but

448
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:20,150
I think it but I think I'll be fine I'm
it probably have to investigate both

449
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,150
like how twisted implemented and

450
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:26,760
DNS Python implemented on I know that
and

451
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,860
that Spotify has a Duncan Allegri's all
over for a lake at the service

452
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,789
to look up so on I mean so long as you
can to thoroughly understand

453
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,929
the the protocol I guess then I'm can't
be too hard but

454
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:43,210
it should be a fun exercise actually hmm
yeah

455
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,960
and I i think im at a time but if anyone
wants to catch me outside I'm

456
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,960
then I'm the let's do that thank you
again

457
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:08,610
one place

458
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:15,610
thank you he's helping stage yes

459
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,370
months
