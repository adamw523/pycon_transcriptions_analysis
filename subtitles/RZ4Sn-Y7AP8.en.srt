1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,920
it looks like it's still a few people
coming in

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,240
on fact a steady stream of people coming
in if there since placing your order if

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,089
you could please defragment would

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,220
make life a lot easier

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,220
squee up

6
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,289
well as German it's great to see a
completely packed house here for our

7
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,680
our last session after lunch here at
icon 2014 in Montreal

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,390
%uh it's quite clear that our next
speaker needs no introduction

9
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,159
no I every please welcome pythons
favorite mad scientist a paisley

10
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:15,340
I

11
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,500
all right there thank you very much that
that this by 10 to come up the most

12
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,900
boring talk title in pie at the pike on
defected 12 reviews in there

13
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,940
soonish Africa vet have terrible tile on

14
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,390
so what this with the stock is about
kinda weird topic in 2005

15
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,350
as a higher take a look at one have
terabytes of source code in a secret

16
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:34,940
vault

17
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,310
will talk about how you get that much
source code in a second on

18
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,310
and then at six years later ended up
testifying about concurrency an event

19
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,300
loops and US District Court

20
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,350
I'm you think oh good god what was that
about

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,520
it was if not to judge Wapner by the way
on

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,170
and so what this talk is about it
actually discovery in with pie pan

23
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,200
are basically bringing pipeline into a
legal battle

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,400
I think in this picture the chair is
Python okay so like

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,080
with what this is about I'm and just
kinda kinda Sep this out

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,960
on I don't disclaimer everything this
talk is true

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,850
but all the names and details been
changed I could've non-disclosure I'd

28
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,160
have to kill you ever take a long time
in this room and

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,580
on so so basically just a bit as I know
nothing in your gonna learn nothing so

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,890
just keep that inactivate much on

31
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,980
now ther to set this out on gonna meet
Allah

32
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,670
donated Alice and Bob I meet Alice

33
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,690
meet Bob I every time a crypto graffiti
on okay so

34
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,080
out about a bob for whatever reason
wants to send Allison message

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,459
that that she will understand to do this

36
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,150
he's going to employ attorney bob's
attorney

37
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,070
ban be in there and the attorney is
going to

38
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,450
a in new calyx with a patent
infringement lawsuit along with an evil

39
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,060
laugh

40
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,340
on I don't know what happened between
the two of them because this but I a

41
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,820
patent infringement lawsuit

42
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,250
on Alice been fortune has somehow
managed to find

43
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,540
Lawrence Lessig to Def and her I was
going to crush

44
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,840
van in this in this battle here
basically with this talk is about

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,010
is essentially patents in some sense I
mean

46
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,090
you these are things that you hear about
a lot the news a patent infringement

47
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,170
softer patents or other bullshit
novelist up

48
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,019
on I'm not I'm not gonna we talk so much
about that

49
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,340
except to say that if you ever get into
a patent litigation

50
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,660
it will turn your world upside down the
reason to get into in a sec add

51
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,750
on and it's also something that is kinda
that the background at the talk

52
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,560
I meet a world okay why did why did Dave
said in a fault with wanna have

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,700
terabytes source code on

54
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,720
he was basically in the context of a
patent litigation

55
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,209
and and where it came up is sorted in
this

56
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,959
this time-line what happens in a patent
lawsuit what happens in these lawsuits

57
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,200
is that some you know the Super get
filed

58
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,880
and then kinda goes quiet for a while

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,910
I mean like it kinda follow the news you
know it's like us and company sues

60
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,329
there's only one answer goes quiet on

61
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,000
be the cases such a goes into a phasing
out its packed

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,920
discovery which might last a year maybe
even more because it goes on for a while

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,510
on and essentially what in what's going
on in that fact discovery phase

64
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,870
is the lawyers and the teams are trying
to figure out just what in the world is

65
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,700
going on

66
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,260
on essentially what you have if the
plaintiff in a case

67
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,280
is saying while there's obvious patent
infringement right

68
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,830
and earthworm persons a snake great know
what that's about

69
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,060
I have the defendant essentially saying
well know there'd but things are

70
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,810
obviously

71
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,970
different right there is no infringement
on

72
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,440
yes they have it yet these two sides at
what is happening

73
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,520
in in this artifact discovery is that
that that that

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,990
the two sides essentially have to to
take

75
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,150
data from the case which might be things
like specifications and drawings and

76
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,800
documents and software and so forth and
sort of figure out what the

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,820
a quote backs are in in this legal case
and

78
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,340
you know it in it if not usually are
really clear-cut thing

79
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,710
many times right i mean it's it's it's
not an obvious thing or two about

80
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,110
obviously different or its obviously
obvious obviously them

81
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,150
so to do this on usually what happens is
a fact expert

82
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,010
were an expert witness or something like
that is called in to look at the

83
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,340
look at the facts in the case of
something involving software

84
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,810
it could be. something this room

85
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,080
myself in this case I mean to you
typically

86
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,520
what that what lawyers are looking for
some cut technical expert

87
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,840
I that is unbiased me not employed by
either the parties or have a

88
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,280
relationship with them

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,250
I would be something that wouldn't
hopefully know somebody so they they

90
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,280
typically tend to target what university
professors

91
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,840
people like that you know that that know
things in any sense they're gonna

92
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,819
they're gonna look

93
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:01,560
look at the facts in the case and what
you have is kinda burn

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,919
you know a team to look something like
this you know me bob attorney

95
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,629
you have a a bunch of coworkers you like
we got these are the fees are usually

96
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:09,259
like the

97
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:12,550
people the law firm who haven't made
partner yet they're like they're

98
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,590
jobs on the line fact expert I'm in
reality

99
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,509
it's actually probably more like this
arm Bob attorney

100
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,500
with with coworkers the fact expert I
looks like that

101
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,900
in my case that that's me on that picky
when it looks like to bike

102
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,129
in the Chicago winner by the way I'm I
don't know whether people thought the

103
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:34,740
first talk in this session but they're
talking about

104
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,770
biking in Montreal so I would assume
it's kinda similar to

105
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,970
how so so that's that's kinda the team
and if this happens to you it's actually

106
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,430
a really fascinating experience like if
you get

107
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,190
get the call so to speak said a when he
come in and look at some source code for

108
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,889
a patent infringement suit

109
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,930
are you're essentially gonna be trapped
into just a huge firestorm

110
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,099
hell actually I because what what's
going to happen is there gonna drop you

111
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,300
into this case

112
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,729
with no technical guidance really I'm
and the reason

113
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:05,810
that they don't there is a kick in the
guidance is that's because the

114
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,150
why they called you actually they don't
know what's going on and so

115
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,870
I'm so some other things that they're
gonna happen is you're gonna get end up

116
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,639
getting into the

117
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,340
really quick learning say phase would
like we have to learn with the invention

118
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,259
accordance with Patton is a that BS like
what is it about

119
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,490
I'm to do that you're gonna get all
sorts of really fun

120
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,039
reading assignments like you have to
read the patent itself which might look

121
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,370
something like this where it's like

122
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,710
you note the system of claim 5 or 6
wherein the display and input means

123
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,680
comprises display means that maybe they
can read that

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,659
and and like get out it's like your head
just take a

125
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,280
head explodes I yes from the movie
scanners which is

126
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,289
ago a great Canadian work apart actually

127
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,220
sup I so I so you have the you do you
have that

128
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,659
I'm in in the case if in the case if
this thing the Patton

129
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:02,509
actually had six hundred pages at C code

130
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,500
attached to it as a PDF printed in 1989
unlike a dot matrix printer

131
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,750
on and you get these fine job so it's
like

132
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,659
okay at this the we do with this convo
on

133
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:17,979
I ended up having to basically compile
the code from here

134
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,750
I mean that this is something like
you're going in as an experts like is

135
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,960
this patent

136
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,650
exit BS like that even work I'm could
you explain this code to

137
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,830
to other people so on the very first
thing that happens is you have to

138
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,060
your you have to figure out this
invention in the case if this thing

139
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,280
on actually printed out all the code
inside owned a highlighter

140
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,969
over the weekend and highlighted of
function definitions and of function

141
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,890
calls

142
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,320
it's only available in paper basically
Isaac printed out you highlight all

143
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,550
function called how highlight all our

144
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,790
all function definitions and so forth on

145
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,060
in a diff using Python to manually
linkage I

146
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,850
did to you censure you would you entered
into despite my data structures

147
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,620
I from you know paper copy and then you
just crank it

148
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,170
through Python to do with a manual
Lincoln what's going on here

149
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,740
the measure trying to figure out whether
that code is actually complete to the

150
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,950
nafta vote that have holes in it other
like missing chunks on it

151
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,280
chunks in the code that kinda that kind
of thing I'm

152
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,170
I'm not going to explain that Python
code and in great detail

153
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,550
except to say that if you're not using
this comprehension and set apprehensions

154
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,380
in the collections module

155
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,610
you're missing out on an awesome secret
weapon for getting all sorts of problems

156
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,100
solved okay so

157
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm so you you he said after weekend

158
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,940
you like this code argue would say why
would you why would you do that

159
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,340
one of the things that that will happen
in this legal case is it at some point

160
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,769
if it continues far enough

161
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:51,000
you're going to be asked about that
cologne maybe

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,899
like under old or something like that
and if you don't know how it works

163
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,990
you're gonna look leaf freakin bad right
okay so

164
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,040
I'm it so you what you will die
basically later if you don't understand

165
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,980
ago

166
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,000
so soap part of what happened is you
have to understand your like

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,950
your own side go that's gonna be
interesting

168
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,190
so horrible in a way I i might be the
only person who had the link

169
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,899
a six hundred-page the program by hand
on paper and

170
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,899
python script so as they do that but
then it but then it actually gets

171
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,399
get even more interesting in these cases

172
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,910
on you actually have to deal with the
other side

173
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,649
so so you have hours here I'm what's
what's gonna happen

174
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,740
you know on that side is a you're
essentially dealing with

175
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,459
like a whole different organization
dealing with some some company

176
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:43,269
there very hostile to you so you have
alice is group at ninja

177
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:47,230
Rockstar coaters you know they've been
they've been doing things

178
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,709
up because you're filing probably a
packed like a

179
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:54,100
like Center filing a lawsuit you would
actually

180
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,430
probably not be suing somebody with no
money

181
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,230
but probably actually not a bunch of
ninja Rockstar coaters actually instead

182
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,810
probably what hours has is a bunch of
Engineers

183
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,430
and they're probably SEIA CMMI Level
four certified with like an ISO 9000

184
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,310
certification

185
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,010
okay so arm your it but this is you get
the other side in something like this is

186
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,889
typically not

187
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:20,139
like a startup company okay it's some

188
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:23,810
something else and what they're going to
do

189
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,889
is essentially kill you with

190
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,670
with with documents now this is it
insane so it's like in in this case

191
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,670
show up the lawyers actually took me to
a room in a sec a year we could get a

192
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,959
printout

193
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,040
you know and can you take a look at the
print out some just to put it like a

194
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,220
number on it

195
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,630
on rema paper is 500 pages

196
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,660
a box of papers 5,000 pages

197
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,730
they had a up 100 boxes

198
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,420
have printed paper five hundred thousand
pages printed actually literally printed

199
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,810
out

200
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,170
in a room stacked up they didn't know
what it was

201
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,529
on 300,000 pages if it were TPS reports

202
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:06,889
softer change notices things like that
on

203
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,139
the other they don't don't do it I'm
summer the other stuff that you find in

204
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,019
there are on

205
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:16,589
quote source code

206
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,649
but you don't know anything really okays
like all the other says print out the

207
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,589
object file to hourly math

208
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,970
right okay so you know turnout has been
a source code on

209
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,970
you might get boxes emails you know
here's a email from Guido

210
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,199
RE said hey fire design language FIU's
braces

211
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,639
rightly you'd like you can take that to
the lawyers and they all and I found the

212
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,670
smoking gun in the email about some

213
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,209
itself say fine at on you get things
like alleged prior art

214
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:46,470
from all over the place like schematic C
Mike its software were you don't even

215
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,260
know what in the world it is from

216
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,940
like 1983 year you know assembly code
are you know it's like i don't know

217
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,880
the ECB anybody actually recognized that

218
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,060
and added that plat 6

219
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,070
now forget to get a whole bunch
unrecognized stop

220
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,920
on but legal team might actually be
deposing people at the time to make it

221
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,350
like a

222
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,060
deposition up some crazy gray bearded
guy right now so

223
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,980
ob cell you know it it will help add you
know bring out some stuff

224
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,190
saying well yeah I spotted this in my
basement wellville

225
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,350
no further winter holiday or something
like that so so

226
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,339
you get your gift that I'm and then in a
really fun part is you're gonna get all

227
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:26,480
their software

228
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,279
to this is in some way kinda awesome
because what when you get into a legal

229
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:33,380
case lingered on the other side they can
ask for anything

230
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,190
and say hey when he just give us the
whole code base handed over at all

231
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,820
proprietary

232
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,279
proprietary software in the case that
this

233
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,550
David after the software it was actually
sitting over in a fault

234
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,630
on the west side of chicago on and

235
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,079
just just add up with some perspective
on this so it's a match in that this is

236
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:54,269
the ad what they've

237
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:57,440
Chicago here essentially be a

238
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,750
bio to my kids here you have for this
fall

239
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,509
in kind of a secret location that is
actually a picture the your fault by the

240
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:05,420
way

241
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,570
outside nondescript nondescript building
acid in national by the train tracks

242
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,740
and coincidentally right next to the
rock band rehearsal space

243
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,029
said I was there you can see it

244
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:22,050
I'm actually in that picture by the way
there's a party rock band there so I

245
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,690
it's always gonna

246
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,980
it national in this very sketchy part of
town I

247
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,910
the protocol for the ball is can't have
any computers

248
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,959
no phone electronics no storage and that

249
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,290
you bring a pen and paper book that
that's pretty much it

250
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,850
on they had a PC locked in a cage

251
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,269
along with the printer in a log book on
so that so that that was what was in

252
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:44,990
there

253
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,360
on as far as what be found there was
just at large collection up

254
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,800
hard drives basically immediate 1/2
terabyte hard drive

255
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,860
and as far as it what it was there look
like they took

256
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,490
maybe up a gigantic box of compact discs

257
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,069
and I just copied it on air in no order
it whatsoever all say a little bit more

258
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:05,980
about

259
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,190
what it is in a second but just you know
you just imagine tyke going through your

260
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,750
closet use them in a fight every compact
discs but I see in the whole room and

261
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,139
I'm just gonna send it over to the other
side

262
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,880
nigga put on this machine so no no
organization at all

263
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,720
are and just a just put a little
perspective on how horrible this is no

264
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,500
way I'm

265
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,670
database actually produced like the
software archive for pretty much

266
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,160
everything related to this thing on

267
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,000
to you can have the invention and the
things that they were producing with

268
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,579
things like

269
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:38,940
you'd like embedded microcontrollers you
had keypads display module seven segment

270
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,110
displays

271
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,910
your PC they had made a custom PCI board

272
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,660
with its own custom operating system
custom software for that

273
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,670
on system action: involved a second PC

274
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,670
so you have like all these different
components she had all the software for

275
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,009
all of these things like

276
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,399
so if you wanted to know what the
firmware was in the display like the LCD

277
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,829
display module you got that

278
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:04,380
yet so that they can I gave you the
whole the whole works on

279
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,449
infection or a distributed system in
fact there's like a custom router

280
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:12,639
multiple copies of devices up the
software for this is out what I would

281
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,130
describe

282
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,009
all stack not to force back but like all
stack so

283
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:21,190
I'm they have like effect about a
million lines of code involving c plus

284
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,870
plus

285
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,730
see assembly Java Visual Basic

286
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,250
asap you know it it's sort of things
like they had their own distributed

287
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,600
object systems decom korva

288
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,360
hope the whole the whole works there are
and then on top of that the time frame

289
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,220
at this

290
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,440
that this thing was basically over 15
years so that turns out how to get one

291
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,860
and a half terabytes

292
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,449
you basically hand of God 800 snapshot
to that system

293
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:48,610
over like a 15-year period with also
took multiple hardware revisions

294
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,910
on configurations different operating
systems OS two

295
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,149
Windows NT and so forth and they don't
happen at

296
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:58,920
they had like custom to the skins on
this software customize for big

297
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,290
corporate clients so it's like there's
like a big corpus system there but all

298
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,579
these custom skins on it

299
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:08,280
also 200 interlocking versions and so
forth and so

300
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,310
on it's also what my job is it is it is
basically did tell the lawyers like what

301
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,360
is this thing

302
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,300
and be provided tools or Windows XP

303
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,430
awesome on the Windows command prompt

304
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,150
possum at the search my I itself

305
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,350
yeah awesome I don't know whether I yeah
people

306
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,170
trip remember the Windows XP search
might but yeah pretty pretty awesome

307
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,780
I you could use notepad ball because
that came with Windows and then

308
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,550
up because they're feeling generous
they've had visual studio

309
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,560
okay so time you had all these a

310
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,290
all these tools on their I'm you could
print anything that you want it turns

311
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,190
out no fault

312
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,240
out but had to be flogged and it was
copied in given to the other side

313
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,940
nothing really happens and likes secret
a lot of these lawsuits like if you're

314
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,220
gonna print something out

315
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,570
because you think it's interesting the
other side is going to get it to

316
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,740
okay so you are you could you could you
could you could do that but

317
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,190
be at the other side would know what you
were doing and then there's some other

318
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,370
constraints as well

319
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,200
on there was actually no working
hardware setup could run the code

320
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,590
on US you can build the code either
because missing libraries I'm

321
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,750
no tech support you can't call up the
other side saying hey we're a

322
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,440
market for the guys are suing you I'm
kinda confused about this code in

323
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,299
you know tell me about it so those that
in a very fragmentary a documentation so

324
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:33,309
so you look at this shelter hadith
horrible tho

325
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:37,010
here's the here's the interesting thing
on it turns out that

326
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,500
on in the fall want to go over there

327
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,610
I fired the command prompt I type a fire
on it comes up

328
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,710
and what how did it come up like like
now I know it's like

329
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,190
I mean this is this is I write this is
odd I mean if you've ever use Python and

330
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,250
Windows

331
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,559
does it get installed in the path no

332
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,400
right it in the past like who put it
there in the path I'm

333
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,549
the only the only gas on S

334
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,559
is that it was probably used by IBM is
an

335
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,280
as part of an OEM tool I was actually
talk to Brian curtain about this at one

336
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,659
point he could he doesn't up with the
pipe on Windows is likely a we get

337
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:19,169
we got occasional like virus reports
from users thing he wants is Python

338
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:23,360
thing on my machine I just bought it it
was used by something by the vendors are

339
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,049
took turns out it was dare

340
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:29,840
for reasons unknown and of course that
so to change the whole picture right I

341
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,010
mean if you've ever had this this this
spot like are you up i dont be really

342
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,470
awesome

343
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:38,419
desert island language this this is like
the perfect chance to like tried that

344
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:40,620
theory out right side

345
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,679
bad battery batteries included up by

346
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,030
a good fortune I actually wrote the
Python book

347
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,840
right so on I thought I was allowed to
bring books into the vault I'm like okay

348
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,350
I'm gonna

349
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,380
I'll be back and I'll be in my book on
and

350
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,860
kinda the that the strategy on it is I'm
gonna go in there and I'm to build

351
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,830
basically

352
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,510
software entirely from scratch in the
ball to do this

353
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,150
i download a talk about that before it
before getting to that

354
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,500
I do wanna just race one questions like
What What Rd what are the objectives of

355
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,780
this

356
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,820
exercise exactly like me that this is a
very unusual project with like the

357
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,270
lawyers are just saying hey cookbook at
the code names like

358
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,360
book yet but what is that up so

359
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,620
if I ever had to describe it the
objectives and they're kind of this

360
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,110
I'm one of them was just sort of this
what question like what did they give us

361
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,360
because nobody actually knows they know
that there's a bunch of hard drives in

362
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,039
there but like what is it

363
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,299
on that the other things just how does
it actually work

364
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,440
we'll get to that in in the third one is
the more weird one is like

365
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,950
because as the patent case ultimately
you have to answer where in that code

366
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,809
does the patent exist that's the weird
is that the weirder one so

367
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:55,570
I'm talk some other time the horror on S
I'm essentially the first part a bit

368
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,360
is your gonna have to reverse engineer
the whole building firemen of whatever

369
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,150
this is like finding like what are the
components

370
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,549
how do they get built for the complete
what are they are the BX these are the

371
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:07,150
deal elderly plugins

372
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,289
are you might have to do something like
just pick

373
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,429
like some you just pick like a directory
of code ECP could pull it apart

374
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:17,600
you might look at things like make files
you know thing

375
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,549
okay what your sources years libraries
this is a lot of like just pencil paper

376
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:22,080
like

377
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,620
right we're we're just like up gaddis
horrible

378
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,539
on it's like the last iraq assembling a
actually

379
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:35,220
don't ask how I store this picture from
Titus brown's last talking last section

380
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:35,590
here

381
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,970
on its copyright infringement right side
up

382
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,559
notice and I think it's at effect checks
are puzzled words like you

383
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,130
units like okay here all the pieces go
to put it together

384
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,549
so from for some other ways that you
that you do this is

385
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:54,020
but the first thing it should be obvious
if you have to re implement UNIX

386
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:59,950
okay so on so that's the that's the
first the first step so a lot of it

387
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,200
I'm decade that the search might

388
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,279
it now I mean AKC have you have to do
some basic tooling to

389
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,860
to do this turns out to be like pretty
easy

390
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,630
to do a lot and want to think that you
can do is use the like a pipe up nigga

391
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,210
like you just

392
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,250
implement like basic Unix commands using
like simple python

393
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,850
statement you know what basic navigation
stuff

394
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,700
job this is rare that 6 like the six
line program that will do

395
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,750
DF between two files

396
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,460
michael has def live like you know you
need a you can we can you can to defeat

397
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,460
you can build up with a little likable
collection tools

398
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,929
and you might just use the Python
interactive shell to just do your

399
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:42,630
navigation isn't the Windows command
shell kinda

400
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,799
Sox out for you know what you that so
I'm so

401
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,809
in actually in one sense what you're
doing here

402
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,809
is if you're kind of building your own I
Python

403
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:55,740
from scratch alienated the yard admit
the tickets ticket to

404
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,789
very stripped down one but you're really
just sitting over there with the book

405
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:01,590
saying on to reinvent everything I need

406
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:06,549
as a need in the in the ball on charge
that is sorted sitting in their unique

407
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:07,919
gifts in fines and

408
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,320
and and and so forth on but then what
you been we start do is you started

409
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,990
started way here on this thing he said
okay like that UNIX but now I'm gonna

410
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,850
start doing some

411
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,130
some some workflow kinds of things where
you might

412
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,669
you might do things like okay and I'm
your FB like my to start with a python

413
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,429
pancho here's a function that will
produce

414
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:31,279
every single directory name and file
name on the whole machine

415
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,309
I I tested this out with like every
pipeline version

416
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,140
that existed as a sample you might say
okay well wake up I wanted to find all

417
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,820
files in all versions of Python

418
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,190
just fire this at it you just start
spitting out file

419
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,669
and then that with that would become you
know media component in your sister

420
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:50,250
need to start building things on top it
were you'd say well you know what what

421
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,350
it would give us exactly like water all
the file types up everything on all

422
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,049
those one-and-a-half terabytes have

423
00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:02,510
a desk you'd say do something like this
a harmonica histogram all file types

424
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,630
and just couldn't come to see you were
to their Lee County Python files are

425
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,409
there how many see files are there

426
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:10,549
you might actually look for things that
are really interesting like unusual file

427
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,159
format I actually

428
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,230
something more interesting things would
be things like PDF files and Doc files

429
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,020
for

430
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,580
reasons that will get into later but
because it can inspect what's there

431
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,690
maybe that would become a come and other
component maybe you would write some

432
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,809
code to find

433
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:28,900
like find things you know your say now
okay I wanna find all tight on files

434
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,220
onto a search

435
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,039
again you're trying to you try to
uncover things on this huge collection

436
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,400
of hard drive images

437
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,440
CD images to do things do things like
that

438
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,740
are you migrate little utility things
where I want concrete a manifesto all

439
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,510
versions of cold crypt

440
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:49,230
we are provided to us just like you to
put a regular expression

441
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,260
in and talk to your cell you we do
things like this maybe

442
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,520
run it and identify like all versions of
Python and

443
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,490
and and so forth so you can't build up
bike tools for you would say things like

444
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,549
okay identify which

445
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:03,580
there and maybe start writing out
manifests up

446
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,909
YouTube you century doing a big
inventory job

447
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:10,480
searching through all this day to find
all the versions of things trying to put

448
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,580
it together

449
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,890
on the whole time you're you're sorta
you know consulting with lawyers in a

450
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:19,830
way saying I was over there and I found
you know 700 versions of the software

451
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,840
noticed f.y.i you know there's you know

452
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,419
700 versions that a million mines at
Seco Road I'm

453
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:30,559
that that kind of thing and so you do
kinda you can't you can't build up the

454
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,770
fees were closed

455
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,820
I'm and then you can just start piling
it up on

456
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,820
sorta sorry even higher one of the
things that happen in this project

457
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,340
is that the beast snapshots were just
sort of scattered randomly overall the

458
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,899
desks it was too hard to deal with

459
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:49,070
so sort implemented kind about on a

460
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,380
absorbed virtual file system if you well
as credible layer

461
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,890
where you could just enter in like us
like a software version and it would

462
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,090
just take you there

463
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,100
and you didn't have to worry about all
that the way that was actually structure

464
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,390
kinda clear it up on and

465
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,340
some other stuff that you would do there
are just take all the software versions

466
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,830
you would find out things like
development timelines

467
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,529
all the versions like how Ranger dates
did they go over today

468
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:19,919
debate overlap in some sense your most
reconstructing things like i'd get high

469
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,720
you know like you know 14 you know like
history or something like that you're

470
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,669
doing it almost in reverse actually

471
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:29,200
you're taking a much snapshots in trying
to recreate history

472
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,529
prominent up some other things that you
would do is is are right like right

473
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:34,309
coder you'd say things like ok give me

474
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:38,149
every version of this file that has ever
existed like you could say

475
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:41,240
on you know quite yet but you could you
pick

476
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,649
like a version: by I'm using Python is
an example that you could say hey give

477
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:45,190
me every

478
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,860
version of thread that CD that has ever
existed

479
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,360
and would it would go through these like
800 snapshots and it would produce like

480
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,130
some history saying well you know in

481
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,380
inversion 12 and 13 was exactly the same
and then like you know all

482
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,820
like version to all the way up to 2.1 .3
there's like no

483
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,730
7 versions of code words exactly the
same again we're trying to do is take

484
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,340
all the stuff and decompose it break it
down and

485
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,220
into inventories on it popular also

486
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,919
a lot navigational tool in like if you
needed go somewhere you can write little

487
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,330
few functions read say hey I want to
look at see a bow

488
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,510
in this version of python and maybe
would launch a visual studio or

489
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,159
something

490
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,529
because United have a whole lot a choice
on editors write you can't you can't

491
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:28,700
install anything on this machine so

492
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,970
for work with work with what you got so
you to build up

493
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,520
you build up all the stuff and you don't
want one comment on this

494
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,159
I'm not actually I'm not sure that the
other side in this case

495
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,370
ever anticipated that we would figure it
out

496
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,070
like me I think that was kinda the
expectations like we take every CD in

497
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,270
the closet

498
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,990
you know in archive we're gonna send it
to him and let him figure it out

499
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,840
on ethnic in reality I which he almost
knew everything about everything

500
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,429
like when you all versions of everything
that they gave us in like timelines and

501
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,730
also to study was all

502
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,669
inventory I don't think it would have
been possible all Alpine

503
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:10,169
like I can't even imagine doing that but
no patter like

504
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:13,740
search like the searchlight and notepad
by Howie Day

505
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,080
I I was actually I was actually thinking
about it recently a pic

506
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,850
how would I have done that I I guess in
the the only alternative would have been

507
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,770
to

508
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,380
you fire up Visual Studio and then to re
implement pipe on I'm

509
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,899
as probably the only II just on how you
with how you how to do that so

510
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:35,890
Sox other colors that out and then you
get into these other

511
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,240
like horrible things with this column in
one of the things that that okay

512
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,840
like to think we just described as
programming what is there

513
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,220
we haven't even talked about how it
works it's more like just what his I'm

514
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,700
so you have this other thing which is
well how does this how does this code

515
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,789
work are

516
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:54,240
and this includes pretty much everything
like the software architecture

517
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,580
interaction between components
algorithms the

518
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,870
you know that the whole thing I mean
expert

519
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:04,539
what you're gonna have to do is take
that million line program

520
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:08,080
and you can have two first we'll explain
it to the people that you're working for

521
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,460
and then maybe later on you might have
to explain it to

522
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,710
potentially like a jury or something
like that so you can't just go in there

523
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,700
for like 20 minutes into your kinda
again

524
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,649
so you really have to pick your have to
pull it apart I'm and in the thing is I

525
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:23,760
reading code

526
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,720
is terrible on your do really wanna read
like a million line program that you

527
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,100
didn't

528
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,000
right I mean it's the top horrible I me
what you want is you want design

529
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,169
dachshunds backs

530
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:36,830
and stuff like that but the best thing
is the other side for a hostile

531
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,390
they don't wanna they want to help you
they don't give you that kind of stuff

532
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,000
so

533
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,029
so what ends up happening next

534
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:48,010
is you go on it when I can best describe
is a gigantic fishing

535
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:53,409
expedition opera things like interesting
documents like pdf doc files RTF HTML

536
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:54,929
text files

537
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:59,490
you do mine enough code comments action
one of the things we did a lot of talk

538
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,450
about his next fight you to search all
source code for the word see

539
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,760
and you see what comes up because what
you're hoping some developer has written

540
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,809
out like a comment like

541
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:11,850
this function really tricky you're more
detail see this document

542
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:16,049
like you you what you're looking for is
like a Michael Michael boost threat or

543
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:16,919
something you looking for

544
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,149
something to to make offer you my goth
looking for all those TPS reports

545
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:24,399
hoping that somebody dropped a clue you
look through everything I mean is

546
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,019
actually

547
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:28,640
your cat kinda thing that you would find
you might find a comment that would say

548
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,590
something like this: no

549
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,080
CFS 6541 AP to oversee details

550
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,140
night %uh it interesting and this action
when the cool thing about fact

551
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,240
like a been a fact expertise you can go
to the attorneys

552
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,980
and you can pretty much get them to do
to unleash any weapon you want on the

553
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,720
other side

554
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,850
right you can so so you can go to them
and you say hey you know I think we

555
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,950
would really be really cool to have this
document FS 6541

556
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,070
EP 20 on and so what happens you know
the attorney will drop the letters and

557
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,820
it often is kinda silent for a few days
you know it the other side is like how

558
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,419
crack like you already know about that
on and then

559
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:07,130
you're magically out at the paper you
get some document you now

560
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,340
Acme widgets functional specification
version 2.0 and inside

561
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,620
you know tag proprietary and
confidential and then

562
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,309
you know if he senses company has their
act together the very first pages that

563
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,649
related documents content then what you
do is you rip dad of

564
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:25,679
and give it to the attorneys in say no
every week or get all that stuff too

565
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,990
odd and you out you but you basically
what unwind the whole access to market

566
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,409
action all the pieces

567
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:37,049
I'm doing things like that any search
everything and stop or change notices

568
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:39,970
unreal you might actually looks up for
software on something like a display

569
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,970
module like firmware for the display
module because I might make

570
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,000
reference to the main application in
some way

571
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,440
and you're just you're just look at the
base but what we're trying to use pipe

572
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,710
porn tube loose thread

573
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,309
you can pull on it as far as you can
pull on it and sand to see you how much

574
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:56,429
what their pain point is you know before
they

575
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:59,570
they do that so up so that that that's

576
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,529
another thing that happens on want one
comment on this

577
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:07,289
I actually think that this is an awesome
exercise if you ever get a chance to do

578
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:10,630
that regardless of what you think about
patents because if you ever get thrown

579
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,299
into a cup

580
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:14,779
i'd like the fire thing that you need to
understand this million my program he

581
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,010
did right

582
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:19,360
with no help at all like no
documentation you gonna learn

583
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,470
tana stop reading that car actually
about

584
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:27,200
everything even like like I'd never seen
stuff with like CMMI Level four

585
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,539
like the software engineering gonna
staff which this group was practicing

586
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:34,450
you get to see that stuff like all the
procedures in their documents and

587
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,799
it's really fascinating to to see that
aren't the only thing is you're gonna

588
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,870
have to teach attorneys about it

589
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,019
on attorneys are not done by the way pat
attorneys

590
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:47,470
usually have science and engineering
degrees they're not of a not a softer

591
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,750
engineers but they're there to pick
their smart guys feel smart smart

592
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,080
men and women know they can understand
it but they but but but you do you're

593
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,490
gonna have to explain it to them

594
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,029
are the other side doesn't want you to
to succeed this so it's a little bit

595
00:32:59,029 --> 00:32:59,690
hostile

596
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,620
arm so you will learn a lot some other
things that that I learned of this is

597
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,559
going to get me into

598
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,600
serious trouble here but this is a these
are the

599
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,850
the Sox rocks lessons up having to look
at other people's code

600
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:16,250
I don't they were doing this project on
c plus plus

601
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,470
an assembly code up turns out that in
assembly code the code is so

602
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:24,470
minimal but it just does what it's
supposed to do the C pas pas code need

603
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,970
at least

604
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,299
18 levels of indirection a design
patterns terror

605
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,350
on a synchronous and threats now I'm
really in trouble here

606
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:35,720
I'm you know that objects functions
there

607
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,860
ID's make filed a pretty much anything
on

608
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,220
actually developed since the nineteen
seventies

609
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,669
I'm it out sorta

610
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:49,730
so distorted this sorted sorry for not
getting notice it's kind of amazing

611
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,620
actually guineas in these cases that
what they're gonna do is try it out

612
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,649
things like prior art enough they ever
get this prior art from 1975 can you go

613
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:58,809
take a look at it

614
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:02,080
and you look at it like this week 3
pages a code

615
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,279
it cool I could understand it right then
you go to compare it to the million line

616
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:08,350
C plus plus programmers like

617
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,740
God like we've done everything wrong so

618
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,540
I had so you know a Chris Chris like
could you could be wrong about that

619
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,320
are event and then the other sorta weird
thing about this is getting into kinda

620
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,070
the weirdest part of this whole thing

621
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,409
on in this fact discovery

622
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:28,280
phase I'm the attorneys are actually
plane

623
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,760
a very different kind of game with a
patent infringement suit

624
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,210
mandate that you're over there looking
at the software and there's these

625
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,639
questions like when I you know dissident
free and you're not and so forth

626
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,100
the attorneys are actually playing in a
kinda weird chess game

627
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,990
that you only understand if you
understand bill clinton's com at

628
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:50,100
about I am you know these famous quote
comes with a mean the word is

629
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,520
but what people like laughed at that my
idiot you know it's like

630
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,130
at the obviously never been and I like a
patent infringement suit on

631
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,880
what it what is going on is the the
attorneys are basically dealing with

632
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,690
that language in the Patton

633
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,930
like you have this horrible claim that
like major head explode earlier

634
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,930
they're actually going through that
entire claim

635
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,460
and fighting about it what it means like
what does this claim mean

636
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,410
and they're gonna fight and they're
gonna fight in front of a judge over an

637
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,680
extended period of time about what this
thing means

638
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,430
and I'm just just just did give you some
background if you love arguments

639
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,590
about things like the Oxford comma this
is

640
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,270
your battle right okay like like if you
love grammar art

641
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,030
act like arguments and and things like
that this is this is what they're kinda

642
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,480
fighting about these things like

643
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,320
on terms and languages like helped I'll
take a claim in of a central processing

644
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,780
unit was at me

645
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:48,330
in the defendant will say what you have
to be like a model 800 486 you know

646
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,880
version to exactly two hundred mayors
the other side will say what could be

647
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,370
any computer at all

648
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:56,470
and then you know the plane air force a
while display could be anything the

649
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,670
other side will have to be seven segment
display

650
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,650
and they're gonna fight over this I'm
extensively about what the definitions

651
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,830
that these terms are

652
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:07,760
and the thing is here's here's the
catch: I'm whatever they decide the

653
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,140
terms are

654
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,290
it actually has to exist in reality like
you can't have a definition

655
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,970
resale here the CPU is this and then

656
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,870
that doesn't exist anywhere like you
actually have to be able to point at the

657
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,510
Patton

658
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,850
say will there it is in the pattern and
then on top of that you have to point at

659
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,310
the other side you have to say whether
it is or there

660
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,660
so they're fighting over these terms you
know such a trying to find things

661
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,430
and I I was trying to ban about this
what you're the other night to get this

662
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,530
is like a knob looking like they can
return it upper gallery

663
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,360
I'm to any level what abstraction they
want like down to the

664
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,590
Adams at the universe or all the way up
to like

665
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:48,520
you know planet earth I hit its very
sorry ive

666
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,400
you know Malo boy away so that that's
the two sides are fighting about this

667
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,550
but ultimately what's gonna happen in
this

668
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,890
on in the software fact stuff you're
gonna have to build a point at something

669
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,090
specific like

670
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,670
if the attorneys say what is the
definition they have to go to court the

671
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,690
code and say you know what

672
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:10,630
in this file food at sea line 230 255
that's where it is

673
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,790
and so this is a this is a problem to
which is well how are you gonna do that

674
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,810
on 800 version that this million mind
program like me to just pick one at

675
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,480
random and say well we looked at that
one

676
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,450
or are you know what would you do on it
the the thing that we did in this

677
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,930
project is we've decided to do

678
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,950
all of them at once and the way that
that was done was doing something to

679
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,020
America fragment version it's kind of
like

680
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,190
I'm source code control but applied to
individual code fragment the censure

681
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,440
what you would do

682
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,050
is maybe I'm identify like some piece of
code that was pertinent to the patent

683
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,680
saying okay well here's this piece a
coding question and you would market

684
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,500
office it may be like up code fragment
think this is

685
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,830
you know this is the file that it and
then it starts with this you know this

686
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:57,390
Boyd crockett ends with this boy blog or
whatever

687
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,790
and then what you would do is write a
script that we go through all 800

688
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,450
snapshots collecting that fragment

689
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,870
across all versions and then what it
would would it would do is collect all

690
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,380
the unique ones that it found like all
the band

691
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,520
three versions turn up at this was this
was highly effective by the way like you

692
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,220
would find these versions that code in
the

693
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,260
like you over the 800 snapshot you might
only find liked 6 persians

694
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,430
some fragment and really kinda the the

695
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,140
thought here as you're trying to reduce
this massive data set

696
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,470
to some kind of scene structure where
you could say well you know this claim

697
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,540
that you have

698
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,420
matches this piece of code by waiters
11:06 version

699
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,680
and here the six persian that's the kind
of thing that you could present

700
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,130
to like a judge or something whoever
same get this this is

701
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,660
this is what what's going on so so is
some comments on S

702
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,860
you know that that have to pay a fine
thing on my dick

703
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:53,720
take away on this whole thing is that
papon in some sense makes Impossible

704
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,370
Project like that possible I mean it
it's like

705
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:00,620
cadmium take horrible were any not even
been able bring your headphones into the

706
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,560
vault

707
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,160
was just like torture I mean it's it's
like you're in this fault code in its

708
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,070
like

709
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,300
using pipe you take this Impossible
Project you gonna break it down into

710
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,750
something that's sane

711
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,040
that you can actually do in my computer
reasonable amount of time

712
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,950
it I mean actually occurs to me that
isn't expert this is prolly the wrong

713
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,100
approach I probably should have used
notepad

714
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,510
so I could charge like 4,000 hours a

715
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,290
a work but no reply fun really am really
broke it down

716
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,650
I was just at the parenthetical comment
that even pipeline

717
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,460
3d makes a makes makes and the
impossible possible

718
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,180
on and so and for some final some final
thoughts on this thing

719
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,050
if you ever get a chance to do something
like this you know worldwide

720
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,840
I'm not sure we want to do it again you
know there's a lot of things like that

721
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,190
weird thing at character building but
you don't wanna

722
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,650
don't wanna go there again ob but videos
it so interesting

723
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:58,220
but here it but you you might say happy
senior the and this is

724
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,430
how how this thing end you know I'd like
I i just bike talk but his legal battle

725
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,520
on I don't know

726
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,430
this is the weird thing about our tony's
legal cases are

727
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,620
you might be called into it as an expert
might work on it for months

728
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,760
and in all this and think disappears and
the just pack everything up goes away

729
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,070
it might've been saddled might have been
thrown out of court I'm

730
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,730
up to this case I do know some details I
know that they lost the case initially

731
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,200
I don't know the the exact details of
the judgment on that but

732
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,050
on but it is it's actually mysterious
like your you're basically only privy to

733
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,910
the

734
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:36,270
but the technical part in the case
you're not privy to things like

735
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,000
like they have a settlement or something
you're not you don't know you don't know

736
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,720
how it went

737
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,250
usually so so and even if I did know I
couldn't tell you anyway so I'm

738
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,650
but the effort for ends abruptly as a is
kind of a footnote on their

739
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,160
getting duty and here on my and game on
this is sort of

740
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,270
curious but arm I learned a ton a stuff
like

741
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:00,000
generator functions using this doing
this exercise

742
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,750
because it was so much data and I
couldn't read into RAM it's like

743
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,900
when we gonna me to do this it I think
it ultimately was the background for

744
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,760
this really well known

745
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,400
generator tutorial if you can carry this
online you wonder why did Dave do that

746
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,220
op it it basically came out the ball

747
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,440
figure of bigger TV actually enough to
actually one cool thing about working in

748
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,520
the fall

749
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,290
is it all code that was written in the
ball stay in the fall

750
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,730
I don't have to maintain I have to do
bug reports it's like

751
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,040
its its god-like not my problem you know
at this point so it's a

752
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,390
yup state say they're are 10 10
postscript on this too

753
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,910
if you get involved with wanna do you
think you might actually go all the way

754
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,860
to writing and expert report

755
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,010
the gets used in like actual you know
the court proceeding

756
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,110
on this is something that is actually
really interesting

757
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:55,200
I'm that all men should just speaking as
an academic sake I used to be at the

758
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,270
University

759
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,680
I we've had this this fear or thought
that nobody ever read anything I wrote

760
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,640
you know this number academics do that
with anybody read what you write

761
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,870
tightest you thinking

762
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:11,100
you take the fifth day I'm is always the
Spirit God even for like my dissertation

763
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,630
and grad schools like and I don't know
if I'd

764
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,840
visor you can read my dissertation so on

765
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,910
so here here's the thing if you write an
expert report

766
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,860
but if you do effort with it should have
to write a report I can absolutely 100

767
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,720
percent guarantee that it will be read

768
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,390
and read at the level up up each satins
down to like things like commas

769
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,010
and stop their gonna they're gonna take
your cycle take it they're gonna one

770
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,890
beach like 10 para we'd like legal
assistant fire

771
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,860
like attorneys I'd they're gonna read
and then they're gonna Hall you into a

772
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,180
deposition

773
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,420
which is usually you a bunch of
attorneys

774
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,490
on a videographer about what I put like
a huge kick it is really cool I get like

775
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:49,750
that

776
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,740
biggest video camera that they can find
right in this little tiny room and shut

777
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,670
your face

778
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,550
you know like timid AU on and you're
sitting there for eight hours and I get

779
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,070
asked about the report

780
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:04,580
are it isn't awesome experience because
you're here's the thing is awesome

781
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,530
if they have read the report and they're
gonna discuss it indep

782
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:13,010
every detail with you and it's going to
be a big conversation about your report

783
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:16,840
and they're gonna they're going to try
to basically destroyed and so it is

784
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,840
it is really awesome or horribly bad
experience

785
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,670
on be it where you could be horribly bad
as a few went in there too I kinda

786
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,700
looked at the patent for like half an
hour in

787
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,790
he kinda looks similar you know that
that's how you would die basically

788
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,910
from there I thought so there's that up

789
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:38,560
court court testimony i I mention that
actually ended up going to court up

790
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,970
talking about concurrency

791
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:44,390
like what was that about are it turns
out it was related to this

792
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:49,040
claim term definition stop there is a
huge battle involving like concurrency

793
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,480
and the judge was so sick of people
battling about he's like okay

794
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,130
everybody come in you gonna teach me
about it are in a love you and i got

795
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:59,860
three hour power point presentation on
concurrent programming

796
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,230
in like I courtroom that the only thing
that was different for like this in a

797
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:04,620
way

798
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,990
except the whole audience with attorneys
and then are

799
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,410
and NP afterwards they had their own
expert come up

800
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,450
and then brief you everything that I
just said to the previous three hours

801
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:19,300
and then I'm and ending haddock this
huge battle was kinda

802
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,410
cut kinda kinda entertaining there so us
let's that's

803
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,800
that into the into the TOC we might have
a time for an hour

804
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:32,800
quest a cluster

805
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,680
how long did you spend in the fall

806
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,320
and how long did you spend specifically
with your pipe on automation

807
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,180
develop so most that this took place

808
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,580
I meant the pride of five months in the
law it started over the summer and it

809
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:59,220
went for like five to six months what
was the second for the question

810
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,210
on the automation arm

811
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,930
I think that that the automation part
was probably stuck outside

812
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,990
under a hundred hours on it the biggest
the the biggest

813
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,400
time sync above all was actually
figuring out how the code worked

814
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,960
i mean because it was like you have this
massive like how do you figure out how a

815
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,490
million mine seaports Plus program works
I mean it's a lot of that was like

816
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,670
pulling code fragments and building like
three-ring notebooks

817
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,180
like things really like what this
Talkster that in this talk to dad and

818
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,580
water

819
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,920
a lot of discussion with attorneys
involving claims like

820
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,040
if you define this like this you're
gonna die

821
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,950
this is the reason why you're gonna die
because like this coat over here doesn't

822
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,540
do that that like with that way so to
what I've like

823
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:44,120
behind the scenes like like consultation
about how things work

824
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,380
how the case has been framed and so
forth yeah

825
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,450
last question so

826
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,620
good heavy lifting just the searchlight
you might have been dead in the water

827
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,780
how they feel about using Python I don't
think they knew

828
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,940
I don't think they know I'm wealth its
ok to call this

829
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,980
their question how did they did they
know that we are using Python

830
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,400
on the up so all that Python code with

831
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,010
living on the fault and wasn't personal
never printed

832
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,720
so there's no printed record have
anything

833
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,890
coming up the case you know if if it had
actually gone to trial

834
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,770
was fully expected that the code would
have been produced probably would have

835
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:24,520
been part of the

836
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,960
production but I but in this girly stage
a fact discovery I don't think they knew

837
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,220
I don't even think are like the side
that I was working on knew what was

838
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,950
going on they just knew that what day
would go over to the ball

839
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,630
but you'd really like David go to the
vault for like a day and he would sort

840
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,420
merge

841
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,270
other at all the other kinda weird thing
about this by the way that the attorneys

842
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,670
asked that I never communicate via email

843
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:49,220
this is like the art this is like the
the ultimate think I'd like don't talk

844
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,120
to us at all

845
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,530
because I like if you'd working as an
expert that can't be produced

846
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,300
later as evidence in there just like
where we don't really know what we want

847
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,160
to do with you just don't talk to us so

848
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,380
attend like the alternate work
environment like you have the client the

849
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,940
client doesn't even want you to talk to
them right so

850
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,170
so what you do is you go over to the on
take over the you go to the vault

851
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,240
you can't work away and then you get mad
from their point of view day would

852
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,020
magically appear from the ball

853
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,070
with this thing like a one you asked for
documents FS

854
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:20,070
861 dash be two or something like that
they're like much interest in and then

855
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,570
yes there's a lot of thing a lot of
things like that

856
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:30,570
thank you became this gentleman place
like david beasley

857
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,580
there's of like downstairs things get
started getting

858
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,320
of an hour or so bookie programs are
thank you very much thanks
