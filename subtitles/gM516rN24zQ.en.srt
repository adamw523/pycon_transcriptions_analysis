description your Sprint I am and be
prepared to give that after the

13

lightning talks

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,010
okay and I would like to present hi new
crossing

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,969
and he's gonna tell us the PostgreSQL a
really is web-scale

16
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:50,969
smiley face

17
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,120
so

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,440
hello nice to be here last talks I think

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,180
in this conference time

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,930
going to talk about skating post sir

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,550
hearst how we what the peace how was
stated that Skype

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,490
what your ways to scale it cannot be
unseen

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,620
and also I have

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,930
tight pussy some more stuff about using

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,600
from Pike so why me to go already cost

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,720
in some places fortunately creko

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,229
already year spoke about some things

28
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:36,060
I had prepared so I can skip over these
really cost

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,619
and so let's get started so

30
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:48,619
her undercutting ok

31
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:53,820
your con the word I

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,960
by feels her since about version 1 maybe

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,020
edited before post she also sings

34
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,280
course before it to us SQL

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,080
it someplace very ok suppose cuz

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,299
she was telling was called post players
sorry essentially a new SQL database

37
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,700
here though it was already a friend
relational database

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,970
your swat at Pacha

39
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,989
contributor do both high command post
Chris

40
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:27,690
both her small amounts of Michael been

41
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,239
I Ross first PBA and they have is
architected Skype

42
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,079
it's the newspaper had

43
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:39,420
fortnight most risk consultant second
part on

44
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,430
secular say say company that the bros

got social support 2013 some

47
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,750
high-level help them come to us and they
are so

48
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,810
think the code

49
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,140
investment company of this tone and
holding yes Skype so

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,489
they have some very interesting stuff
night help them

51
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,900
evaluated I have also

52
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,510
to books under PostgreSQL it'd

53
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,139
who okay I see that they're

54
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,310
under echoes sure what to do about it

55
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,739
one of them is have a close guess good
administration

56
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,489
Ohio together simon rex police their

57
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,970
hit KO for second car truck or so away
with this

58
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,280
both discussed several programming a
book which

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,470
physically tells you how to write stuff
insight

60
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,099
both Tesco server that turns your see
B&B just let it be a python

61
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,280
see the art auction skating and so on

62
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,419
so what this python

63
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,689
okay actually know what that by Tony so
I'll going to bed

64
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:59,200
but its really I sent universal language
is

65
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,269
for almost ever Fink what is no escape

66
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:09,500
know it's girl is usually yes mostly
it's a storage

67
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:15,530
some thanks it has some language in it
it can be a secret keeper Justo riches

68
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,299
the structure values Press databases
distributed

69
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,530
she's some do you use

70
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,979
it's good so already somewhat

71
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:31,050
for what I am discredit late skating

72
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,050
can also lets the West Center not

73
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,330
the only esker so

74
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,199
why people used the West its pissed it's
simple to

75
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,139
implement its quite often the

76
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,030
really a great variation other team that
lets use fights for Speed

77
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,949
which works small-scale and doesn't work
very well

78
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,699
large-scale now they somehow less girls
adroit

79
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,830
to play large

80
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,669
your city's it such a cheap to get
started

81
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:09,010
see for the initial development and 80s

82
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:15,750
skoo storage layer what a pink shirt

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,520
no SQL usually sacrifices compared to
we'll see Korea

84
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,010
database test the that

85
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,389
for be things that databases offer

86
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,139
relational databases are Tommy at the
message the consistency

87
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,620
isolation and durability at the mission
it means

88
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,750
that everything guy that happens

89
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,050
at once so does it happen doors most of

90
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,719
the West but they did have some form of
it quite often now

91
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:50,349
most often it's done just by looking
ever in the collection

92
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,650
and solar you can

93
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,990
happy daughter cell and enter you should
at least have a single

94
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,099
statement told back some so texan's

95
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:07,349
but again have multiple come ons
multiple updates on

96
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:11,529
back together if you didn't like them
consistency is something that

97
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:14,710
most know it's good that the device is
by definition don't have

98
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,990
they are she must resolve that was
nothing to be consistent with isolation

99
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,860
again which means that on bus I the sea

100
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,449
ever seem to be intersection or see
nothing

101
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,139
again quite closely

102
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:37,010
paid at the Mississippi and meeting that
course

103
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,060
your door he was blocking and

104
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,020
usually having by X doing evasion

105
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,240
everyplace database for the duration for
time

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,539
and the durability the many

107
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:55,580
year he newest the database is actually
replaced by your application

108
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,229
make tend to have some kind of local job
elite day

109
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:02,479
but day usually BC limited

110
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,500
quite slow passionate I this week but

111
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,610
in my date every few seconds already

112
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,029
for some type of like the head low

113
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:20,029
usual again not not to any cost what
this post

114
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,229
this the database I most to work where

115
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:28,169
then haven't allowed buscas curly hair

116
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:32,650
to relational database management system
that the changes

117
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,259
it has been in development almost thirty
years

118
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:39,720
last twenty years

119
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,080
search an open source project very
active community

120
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,449
its from the

121
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,229
the beginning it has had a highly
concurrent design

122
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,639
and it asks for donations

123
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:59,169
and it has also and she's done to this
girl language implementation

124
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:05,370
it's not ever cheat cell and if we want
to get

125
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,389
already to some

126
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:12,830
sacrifices for PostgreSQL Ben

127
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,620
there are things that they can switch
off all it without

128
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,669
at the mission the always fun

129
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:23,479
you'll on comet

130
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,490
Hall of the work or it never happened
said

131
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,009
for example of the crash some of your
work the city sums not

132
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:34,520
you can do well consistency

133
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,659
you can eat out point should be

134
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,669
XQ in Orlando the checks

135
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,160
Hill don't want any they protect

136
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,689
on the models and you can use chase next
reached or

137
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:56,339
so you have toward freedom to store what
they like to know that the bases

138
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,980
isolation is always on again other
paralyzed

139
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,280
sconce he your Hoffman work today either

140
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,180
by the sea or or nothing but depends
which of

141
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,439
for durability in many levels

142
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:16,310
Japan your subsequent scummy which means
that you have a few milliseconds self

143
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,319
Taylor window express happens right
after you did call me

144
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:23,870
you may lose some data or

145
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,370
for much more speed

146
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,720
and their but do with the

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,939
at you're gonna lose or the date though

148
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:37,260
you can use on low papers which means
that the day

149
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,839
papers are written only once there are
no guarantees that day

150
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,430
will be there after cash but under
normal operations

151
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,939
the the although I was just trying and
also follow orders

152
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:52,930
no mentors

153
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,910
so Bush cassius much more than a story
slayer

154
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,880
but it has very good stories layer been

155
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,520
and a penalty as a separate storage if
you so wish

156
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,779
if you want to like Joe applications in

157
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,370
that to become the West Coast night

158
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,730
and which will usually be said to have
to create

159
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,839
the complex parts like locking for and
comprise a controller

160
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,290
and and joins there and

161
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,529
more lot of complex stuff no application

162
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:34,770
it easyer there it would be her big hard
cock

163
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,689
but there sometimes it's support for
scalability

164
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:42,260
issue and their publisher or moving

165
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,850
from an existing no SQL

166
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,100
database to post this then you can start
exactly as to where I'm

167
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,559
mortal mall perform on mall consistent
way slater

168
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,949
I did some tests compare memcached
radius

169
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:04,130
PostgreSQL but the the

170
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,910
top lines care all

171
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:13,809
men has set records they are this
command Kasey Kahne consistent

172
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:19,050
ABC's not non-durable Medicis kind of
two-electron

173
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,400
their its doors at state tower

174
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,500
every few second several tens of seconds

175
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,140
and it gets forms like this this post
discuss

176
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,300
repair for months basis PostgreSQL

177
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,730
mister quite stable write performance

178
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,990
not favor doable eighth under our sink
order

179
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,100
which means that tomatoes a few
milliseconds

180
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,910
if I would have been almost there non
log table the same

181
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,120
I guess their performance would be I
don't care

182
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
and these two planes are among the DB
again this maybe

183
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,810
very with additional nobody be because
it's a single

184
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,910
E database Mongo DB

185
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,170
what the Easter present at the their
lowest line

186
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,250
would cease their durable storage Mongo
DB

187
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,040
which is summer around here unit 64

188
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,820
I'll clients sit still only a few
thousands

189
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,230
Russ her both processes for the house ok

190
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,649
inserts were all the sex and gets a
second tape she says

191
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,899
good primary key year

192
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,440
we won running backs NB and Jason

193
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,019
Baker so

194
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:42,060
familiar Craig already went over these

195
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,269
her all kinds of

196
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:48,639
called and technical features a post gus
has a piece rarely

197
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,990
it doesn't act former not till my tester

198
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,560
just a database a kind we define
everything

199
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,170
you can

200
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,220
entrance how it works everywhere

201
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,459
and when your sink papi pipe n you can
ne'er

202
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:12,000
or so do weight BC

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,180
or like things for example

204
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,500
it's not very hard do like the smaller

205
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,250
paying let's chill replace your

206
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,130
select a year

207
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,330
some meta programming and Bender

208
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,010
can make papers look like they wear

209
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,210
are 80 or collections of for

210
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:40,020
classes policy collections of rose a

211
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,790
very small but now let's get the scaling
which we

212
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,470
will tear have door have time to talk
about

213
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,840
anyway at the old so what they're for

214
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,070
once expected to grew

215
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,950
hun it happened about the same time s

216
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,690
Amazon and Google develop their large
database solutions

217
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,200
except that we did on-base done post
Chris

218
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,140
tested or somebody cascading speak
binary

219
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,370
functionality at some point this doesn't

220
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,480
work any more than just our shot the
papers especially

221
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,290
if you have like most adults like we had
Skype

222
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,690
are but the beasts things that way more
than ninety percent right

223
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,290
because they are seldom read only when
you go to any water

224
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,800
your computer other way all

225
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,050
all our time they're just 3.2 and wants
you will have gone to shot think you can

226
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,320
on

227
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,760
do lots of your original casey ten
people aboard water-related 8.2

228
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,740
tapes Hartzell you still have
consistency inside the charger can write

229
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,770
simple SQL

230
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,510
simple programs in other languages still

231
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,130
work close to the Baker

232
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,860
and we wear able to no basically

233
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,130
your maintaining from clients

234
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,690
site the US Equal had a single big
database

235
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,580
butter and their we had their

236
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,810
one of their way through the dross coded
all access to their

237
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,850
tables or to the databases as functions

238
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,320
which means that the clients that I saw
or so any papers

239
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,660
visual contact the supplier usually
ordered you Miller paper Texas store to

240
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,500
see our

241
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,950
functions in which

242
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,340
here and do

243
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,040
would basically just their which we need
to call another database

244
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,450
spend a year yours Pitre like W

245
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,530
the used take a PT connected to other
database query their

246
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,760
it on nurse red

247
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,280
to treat me seconds so daughter

248
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,820
performance problem and their

249
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,170
ok and then ok

250
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,260
that the first one was for vertical
scaling limit for example just big door

251
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,380
look at some place a call

252
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,770
from another database at

253
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,210
horizontal scaling States took whether
Polanski

254
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,750
tapered paper missing that they can
raise anymore

255
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,900
there we started selecting

256
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,190
fractured database connection inside the
function

257
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,370
and where there and for Easter

258
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,390
after under often enough we

259
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,310
maybe the special language which

260
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,390
basically the source code about

261
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,290
where to run the function and

262
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,300
we had two iterations of it first of its
kind of

263
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,360
one big block of code then

264
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,760
mockery voted speak out

265
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,850
be a proxy connection for our and and

266
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,430
PO Box Hill and was proper cook

267
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,560
and after that almost everything

268
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,180
get Skype us week in shot at Manor

269
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,510
you have checked it's a function written
in

270
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,620
I that the ambitious girl Plesk

271
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,950
sometimes be a fighter on the shots and
then how the talks

272
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:23,990
functions on many proxy machines which
can be the same machines this

273
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,170
service as the database to a concert by

274
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,170
can be separate machines and then

275
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,540
you connect to any point and they'll get
the data from was actually stored

276
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,870
with ca

277
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,180
basically like export function at the
preschool

278
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,530
their

279
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,590
hearses with a security source a good
for me

280
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,670
dance bet really tree the separation of
interfaces

281
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,170
you need to pick something you don't
need to shut down plants it just

282
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,740
redefine

283
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,660
function glance continuous before we

284
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,700
you don't need to settle down type
upgrades

285
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:12,700
on the way to Bayside of course need to
test and also a shiney

286
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,810
to some kind of peace to meditation at
the dole database

287
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,700
vanity easy to add two functions and

288
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,100
decir the lesser found out the man

289
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,190
it was all too easy to skate because to
easily by

290
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,260
developing a language be a proxy and
then

291
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,570
stop Inc using it forever

292
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,710
ok ok

293
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,520
and we've heard from problem with your

294
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,260
punches being too limited we initially
let our web developers and

295
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,600
or to apply their own functions and only
went

296
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,700
product was deployed then it went to be
BK stuff

297
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,700
forward pics stuff to make more
performant need

298
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:13,240
ok and the court thing care about the be
a toxic skies harding key step in the

299
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,309
end we still can

300
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:18,289
like for go with that

301
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:22,309
only once in one accessing the database

302
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:26,909
can those tough told many many related
papers

303
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:30,900
it or consistent its Texas controlled

304
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,000
the tests for your AC guarantees there

305
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,880
and the show

306
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,539
to running from place and then you can
might be silly decorate their cell that

307
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:43,590
the basic

308
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,190
you know go and just poor

309
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,380
the database functions as if notable
attractions

310
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,750
sees or so I have done it a few times

311
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,679
it's not hard its just look up our the
code is work

312
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,179
it's done here is a sample how

313
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:08,630
be a proxy works it can

314
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,029
just proxy course and be for an extinct
another database

315
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:18,080
did also can select the database

316
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,220
based on charting say has text of your
surname

317
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,830
or select job and get closest database

318
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,049
already basically can be anything you
can also have function that

319
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:34,840
identical Nexus think based on on the

320
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,770
they have time and for example if you
want to take some

321
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,130
mustered a touchdown for night good

322
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,340
Alexis still read on a database is that
sometimes

323
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,630
it's easy to set up

324
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,929
fuel tree functions partitioning
function

325
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:56,700
which basically returns the power of two

326
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,440
next remix cluster vision functions

327
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,220
which is the one that's always consulted
and exchanges

328
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,240
then the partition function board again
and cashed

329
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,330
and there is also possibly to the parlor

330
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,660
have across the Conficker rate from
function their

331
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,570
first addition function troll two
partitions

332
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,760
can be your and usually more than 20

333
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,450
various class division function

334
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,960
basically of they have changed by
stationing just

335
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,090
redefine this function to attend another
number it must be kept on

336
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:42,520
last month so that configuration would
be reloaded and if you want to set some

337
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,250
options

338
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:48,340
news said options an owl

339
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,620
because this this function know the
cluster name your toes

340
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,130
then you can easily Chester seder

341
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,250
yours cluster your service on has tix

342
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,740
no surname and when your money

343
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,900
to the end function get scored in the
light shot

344
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,660
does whatever the fight to and then it
comes back

345
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,640
and their mother fast to networks

346
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,600
basic stuff hope at Sir

347
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,000
usually less than a second to the hell
country of

348
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,230
of the choir so

349
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:29,470
before us how you already have a skate
database whole we

350
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,480
scaling heater day or would be fine

351
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,990
more then more shots in the beginning

352
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,100
thank you have actually met critical she
took his

353
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,530
databases first developed break lotion
up

354
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,670
each then we need to move

355
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:51,040
you'll move only sure shot

356
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,210
and separate from to for politicians in
a few steps

357
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,000
this is how you end up and basically

358
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,690
babys actually moving just under budget
replication

359
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,330
the to really develop these say in the
back to Skype Dorsett scored

360
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,730
lungfish which is name of

361
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,210
to your left hand from in Estonian to
this book

362
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,880
because everything both Chris has his

363
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,520
somehow related to defense and

364
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,750
basically said that occasion and then
wat how it takes

365
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,090
how long it takes and then you have some
pic

366
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:37,250
so but Bishop don't have function
interface then there is a nice

367
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,760
think info stress for point data purpose

368
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,930
basically you can invite function

369
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,580
additionally see what's presents

370
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,800
tapering shapes to post Chris and

371
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,790
the some nice people have written to
record multi-colour

372
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,230
which led to the sea pipe so we'll

373
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,530
like the pika class and expose s

374
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,820
papered posts it comes 15

375
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:12,820
no Escala comey TS yet I tasted funny
they develop a sexist I'm at to assess

376
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,380
help the samples that expose

377
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,830
cooperman mailbox as

378
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,960
tapered so you can query them

379
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,020
from database for shopping

380
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,340
Europe for anything to basically the
right

381
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,710
close in Payson there

382
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,790
and then expose their make the store
that database

383
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,000
that Bush Chris pastor Craig extension
multi-core

384
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,020
page you don't need to talk it because
it didn't exist

385
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,790
from Mexico they don't create the point
they cover

386
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,140
her and then you'll create the point
table using

387
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,390
its wrapper and then you can just query
from me

388
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:59,030
that's my sister like this class has a
few functions

389
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:04,180
issue 3 only then you need only accepted
method which esquire is headquartered

390
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,530
columns column to column name squalid
cell actually

391
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,600
day XXXL ColumnName operator and value

392
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,700
you can use the story me told Mike they
title

393
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,720
week that how much they don't get from
external stuff

394
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,850
external database in this case I am
doing again

395
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,130
think very similar to be a proxy
physical a select their

396
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,620
based on for on the radio coral

397
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,550
and then directed only rose that been

398
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,570
and then from his petition I dent does
that they needed their

399
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,370
say fights hit update DB you have or so
to section controlled

400
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,780
at the end of detection kantle commit or
rollback

401
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,190
recommit if you want to do two-phase
commit so

402
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,540
the Pacey basic blocks out there

403
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,180
and the nice thing going they seized

404
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,890
kind basic different from BL Python

405
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:07,400
be sexually Kendall Street at the
financially stable and then select ok.

406
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,380
hearst and those from me and it doesn't
blow up database

407
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,880
stars the L fighter

408
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,400
