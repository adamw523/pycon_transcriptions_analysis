1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,270
welcome everyone

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,299
and we've got a great speaker ahead of
us and

3
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:15,100
this is no I can't ritz with Python
packaging

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:22,100
as I cased alright welcome

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,490
I apologize for any one that saw this
was originally called

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,210
what's coming in by the packaging but
unfortunately or fortunately in the

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,759
roughly six months since I wrote the

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,140
proposal most the stuff that I was going
to say is coming soon is actually

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:36,640
happened

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,540
so this will be more of a a review of
the last 18 to 24 months

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,720
think it's a real estate to trade for
months

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,720
by the vaccine development but first a
little bit about me

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,120
on the infrastructure lead for the final
topper foundation where the organizers

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,899
up icon

15
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,219
by day I do server automation operations
work for balance payments

16
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,250
very involved the chef community and I
really like making things

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,989
also disclaimer this list is not in any
specific order not chronological number

18
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,399
importance it's just the order that I
could we've best presentation so don't

19
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:11,039
take this as an endorsement or

20
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,909
disparagement of any particular features
to getting started with a couple

21
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,340
org chart changes in Python community
the first major one

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,759
was the creation of the Python packaging
authority or pie PA

23
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,770
on this is now a group operating outside
the seat height on development team

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,109
although there is some overlap some
people were to spend both groups that's

25
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:31,319
handling most of the non-standard the
packaging

26
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,450
troll development in organizations such
things like pip setup tools virtual and

27
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,139
all that now lives under the pikey a
umbrella organization

28
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:43,990
second was the appointment love new
packaging DFL Nick cop-one

29
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,259
arm hope where pronounce that correctly
democrat for me

30
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:52,029
earlier but never sure these things
anyway he was appointed by kedo as the

31
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,969
packaging the DFL just means that he can
directly except perhaps related for

32
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:56,700
packaging

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,369
without the discussion moving on the
Python dev anyone's on Python dove

34
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,509
probably understand why this is a very
good thing

35
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,739
additionally rich Jones has taken back

36
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:09,050
the man to love PDF l4 the Python
package index itself

37
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,060
so he is back on the saddle for managing

38
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,030
anything where we need to break
compatibility we do try to file perhaps

39
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,480
and he's allowed to accept those

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,480
necessary on the actual features

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,310
I most you probably use the Python
package indexer pipes GI for short

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,080
either host your own packages or two
find libraries to use amid a lot of

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,010
improvements to that

44
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,130
biggest one in my mind is

45
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,580
a lot of TLS improvements we actually
use each

46
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,680
yes now arm and we support all the
latest goody is like

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,240
strips transport security say
automatically default %eh

48
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,450
yes trying to keep it much more secure I
we also offer perfect forward secrecy so

49
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:47,790
that

50
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,540
if keys are leaked how that ever
happened I no one can be crept past

51
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,770
record a traffic

52
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,150
on this one not actually

53
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,540
as recent as some this %uh for
mentioning but a lot of people don't

54
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,380
know exists

55
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,860
there is a chase on API of sorts for the
Python package index image that slash

56
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,620
chase on

57
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,290
tienda by their package for version URL
you'll get all the data of that page

58
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,570
NJ some format so if you have a reason
to need all the packaging information

59
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,750
you could ever possibly want

60
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,780
his real easy way to grab it I we now
have a

61
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,060
CDN powering are the paperback to tax

62
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,870
so its run by fast Lee who gloriously
sponsors it for us

63
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,620
they do a jew distributed caching system
based around varnish

64
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,260
with in automated static fallback so if
our servers

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,410
self-destruct we move to a the
Bandersnatch managed

66
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,530
static nearer in another data center
misled to vastly improve performance

67
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,220
for people that don't live outside the
US since the servers are no longer a

68
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,060
single box

69
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,310
somewhere in Oregon and just generally
improve stability

70
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,800
I because of the CDN

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,750
and combined with the fact that a lot of
the public mirrors were becoming

72
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,180
increasingly fragile

73
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,890
many of them were breaking or no longer
updating had to be kicked every couple

74
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,230
weeks are they fall under sink

75
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,090
with no deprecated the public near
network have you previously read article

76
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,940
couple Moss is wonderful post on

77
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,010
how to use mir's please disregard all of
that are my love to to take up in a very

78
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,330
glad that he wrote that

79
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,470
but no longer needed on we've removed
the DNS entries for them

80
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,459
and tip no longer ship support from
public near network and we have

81
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,469
deprecated in your authenticity ATI

82
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:29,479
that have been removed but I'd believe
it schedule removed in September

83
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,919
also topic amir's up 3-1 client has been
the workhorse for maintaining

84
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,590
local an internal mirrors for a very
long time it's now largely considered

85
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,439
deprecated in favor a vendor snatch

86
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,020
if you'd like to maintain a local here
in it certainly encourage it if you have

87
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,479
large-scale deployments or if you just
don't want to worry about us being down

88
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,520
even though fortunately that's now very
rare

89
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Bandersnatch is definitely the tool use
a DEP TRAI is also somewhat recent

90
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,259
addition

91
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,770
its primary function is not nearing but
it can act as a

92
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,430
partial hearing tool sewers better
snatch large is used for keeping there

93
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,349
is a the entire

94
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:05,409
Python package index dope I heard FBI

95
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:10,150
can mirror only what you accessed
through it as a caching proxy

96
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,159
and finally warehouse so warehouse grew
out of the now-defunct Creteil project

97
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,960
so don't go to create I only more think
it's now being used by some other

98
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
company

99
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,930
but it is going to turn into I don't act
index 2.0

100
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,150
we have a demo site up at Warehouse top
I found at work

101
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,169
it currently supports package
installation

102
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,439
search and most of the TI's you cannot
yet upload packages to it

103
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:37,659
and I think user authentication is being
added very shortly

104
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:41,499
onto how do you actually get packages
from those servers

105
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:45,740
so again you might notice a pattern here
I think some the most important stuff is

106
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,669
around safety

107
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:51,279
possibly added in pip TLS verification
and we've deprecated external links and

108
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,539
dependency links

109
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,210
just means that you can now actually be
relatively certain that you'll be

110
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,279
downloading packages:

111
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,319
in a safe and verified matter

112
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,110
also pepper 453 landed when Python 2.4
shipped or is it landed a little earlier

113
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,309
but is now live

114
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:11,520
for those that don't know insure pip is

115
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,559
the module that we're shipping basically
meaning it is now part of the pipe on

116
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,419
standard library

117
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,539
are not quite actually lives in a
slightly different category but socially

118
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:20,349
speaking

119
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:24,650
if someone installs Python 3.4 on any
platform be it from the source tarballs

120
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,589
or in red hat or any other platform is
expected the PIP will be available

121
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,599
%uh this means we now can finally put
easy install to bed

122
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:39,599
this is a very very nice thing

123
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:46,240
no more easy and stop it

124
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,279
on two wheels so for those

125
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,240
that have played with them a little bit
you've probably seen their basally

126
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,599
simplified installation format

127
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,229
notably they don't require executing any
codes

128
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:02,729
the wheels grew out of the old setup
tools eg concept

129
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:08,189
instead of having a source distribution
file the pic downloads unpacked and run

130
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:10,819
setup i install which is what it does
now

131
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,029
that the the wheel format has things
effectively

132
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:17,369
in the floor mat they need to be when
they're installed on the system's a pic

133
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,039
unjust

134
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:21,979
on Packers a file in a very specific way
but you don't have to actually

135
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:25,020
run any codes do installs this means
that

136
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,779
ok this means that installs are

137
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:32,050
faster and much safer since you're not
executing arbitrary code from the

138
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,039
internet

139
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,339
turns out that's not always a good idea
downside wheels are definitely still

140
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:41,520
feel that development if you have pure
Python stuff they're wonderful you

141
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,319
should use them now

142
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,619
if you have see extensions or other
binary packages

143
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:49,099
you may want to look and play with them
a little bit before you

144
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,059
you going whole hog on Windows and OSX
because they have

145
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:56,419
very stable and long-term platform level
ADI's

146
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:59,960
it's relatively easy to know that if you
compile one channel work on another

147
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,349
that's not quite the case with 1x
unfortunately the wheel center doesn't

148
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,479
currently have any way to express the

149
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,339
complexity is when Xavi's I but we are
working on that

150
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:12,729
if you'd like to get started with wheel
today you can just pick install we'll

151
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,979
and instead of doing Estes store be just
as you can to be dis real

152
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:21,659
and finally on the getting side is a
tool called conduct this was written by

153
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:23,020
continuing analytics

154
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,499
relatively new entrant into the
installer field and maintain

155
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:30,960
made aimed mainly at scientific
environments

156
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,969
it can use a general-purpose installer
but there are some security concerns are

157
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:36,330
still working out so I wouldn't
necessarily recommend that much you need

158
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:36,780
its

159
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,120
a extra features which are largely based
around

160
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,510
scientific packages which need large
binary

161
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,570
barred binary installations things like
psychic learn UNFPA

162
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,500
live side by things like that where you
really don't wanna be compiling the

163
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,790
source largely

164
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,080
because of time and complexity
constraints if you're not doing

165
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,060
heavy number crunching scientific
analysis you may not need to be using

166
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,330
Honda

167
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,640
onto using packages so you've downloaded
them it has done some stuff depending on

168
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,260
the format

169
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,510
now you actually use packages so Vienna

170
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,180
is the evolution a virtual int it
shipped in Python 3.3

171
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,600
the script you call is slightly
different now Heidi Anderson a virtual

172
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
and but otherwise the internals

173
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,690
a are vastly cleaned up and the usage is
largely the same

174
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,220
distribute is gone a big thanks to PG
for

175
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,070
helping to emerge setup tools and the
community for distribute back together

176
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,960
like I said before they're both now
operating under the party a and have

177
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,520
resumed using the setup tools name
anywhere where you were installing

178
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,050
distribute any kind of Scripture
anything just replace it settles

179
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,380
and finally just utils to it did briefly
and up to the standard library

180
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,740
under the name packaging however it
ended up being removed because there are

181
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,770
some concerns when a plantation xanax no
longer under development

182
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,810
so if you were waiting for just a little
too sorry to disappoint them

183
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,750
and now making packages

184
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,730
so improvements the meta-data tip now
supports the idea pre-release is so if

185
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,890
you upload something

186
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,520
with dash alpha or dash beta people
understand that and will only install

187
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,630
them if

188
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,210
specifically requested by the end user
means that you can do pre-release

189
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,760
testing and release candidates and

190
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,510
same manner there's also kept for 26
creatively named

191
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,710
meta-data 2.0 this is my trying to take
all the meta-data that we should have

192
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,690
crammed into packages in weird places
over the years

193
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:36,030
put in one place but in Jason format
have standardized values

194
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,620
as far as applauding packages %uh so a
lot of people use Python setup.py upload

195
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,640
as their uploader

196
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,170
on there is a new project called twining
which is trying to pull all that update

197
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:46,720
lauder

198
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,450
upload logic out of dis utils the
measure this is we can update it

199
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,650
in a much faster way that we can
standard library we're not worried about

200
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,800
maintaining compatibility and things
like that the same way

201
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,610
twine I would highly recommend using it
now just utils for example does not

202
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,190
support

203
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,270
TLS verification uploads doesn't support

204
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,480
the upload a previously created
artifacts things like that

205
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,400
definitely check it out I'm probably
doing was offered a service even

206
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,470
mentioning it because it was shut down
due to non use

207
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,800
but I S H has been removed I'm sorry to
be four hundred people than ever used it

208
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,680
and finally the died up previously
called The Hitchhiker's Guide to

209
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,340
packaging now the Python packaging user
guide is available at package and %uh

210
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,440
Python org

211
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,210
it's basically an expanded version
everything I'm talking about here i

212
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,450
different checking out

213
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,030
and the few things that are still coming
soon like a mention meditated 2.0

214
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,800
is still under active discussion it sort
of the blocker right now for

215
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,760
most future efforts everyone's trying to
sort of centralize around getting meta

216
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,470
data 2.0

217
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,590
before we all go often use all the new
meta data in new and exciting ways

218
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,800
to other things that her right on the
cusp of being

219
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,910
discussed his estas 2.0 real 2.0

220
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,390
I'm like I said the wheel format has
some issues with binary compatibility

221
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,140
yes just format hasn't changed and what
twelve years now

222
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,590
things like that its it's about time for
those both to get our a once-over

223
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,220
especially in light of the new metadata
format

224
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,520
so if you're interested in pursuing
those discussions I will have

225
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,580
slides for you in a moment and also
coming soon like I mentioned warehouse

226
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,400
the hope is that sometime in the next
six months range that will be full

227
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,330
featured enough to

228
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,780
replace the existing project code base
at which point we will

229
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,870
just switch it from warehoused apartment
or it.i to 500 organ welcome our new

230
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,310
warehouse overlords

231
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,240
I do definitely recommend that if you
have anything that's doing a lot of

232
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,150
non-standard scripting or using a judge
directly

233
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,500
on I P I did you try them with the
warehouse top 100 or test site and

234
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,240
report any bugs

235
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,120
fine so when we do that switch over you
will not be suddenly surprise and broken

236
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,250
so what if you'd like to help us out so
like I mentioned the pikey a team has

237
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,860
taken over a lot of projects

238
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,300
they are sort of split though some stuff
is up and get help but notably pip

239
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,260
virtual and warehouse are all manage
into the pipe he ate organization on get

240
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,010
help

241
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,060
and setup tools heiii the old code base

242
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,570
and the wheel libraries and tooling are
under the pikey organization on

243
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,380
pickpocket

244
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,090
so if you're looking about these
projects just make sure you end up in

245
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,280
the repository

246
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,280
there's also an IRC channel on freenode
IRC

247
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,450
pound I T A a lot of the packaging
developers both from the pikey eighty

248
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,250
men from the standard the team even
though most

249
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,460
those are the same people hang out in
their so if you have any questions would

250
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:28,960
like to

251
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,650
learn more about how to help just jump
in there we also have the

252
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,910
venerable old issue till signaling
listed still going strong

253
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,130
it is definitely the primary
communication point for most packaging

254
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,210
discussions

255
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,920
there used to be another mailing list if
you were on it you got a notification

256
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,650
this catalog sega has been merged into
this detail saying that was the old

257
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,970
heiii specific mailing list so long live
digital sig

258
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,310
and finally sprints warehouse team a few
of them anyway

259
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,750
will be here and will be sprinting
during the pike on Sprint's on warehouse

260
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,020
if you'd like to join them

261
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:06,160
fine Richard Jones or any of the other
pipe CA folks and asked me how about

262
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,550
analytic lows with just a few shutouts a
first doll stuffed most you have never

263
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,060
heard

264
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,400
Donald stuffed and unfortunately wasn't
able to make up to Montreal

265
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,220
but I counted he has worked on at least
90 percent of the things that I

266
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,230
mentioned today

267
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,400
and basically runs Python packaging
makes all this happen

268
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:29,400
we all owe him a beer

269
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,370
and another shutout for nicaraguan a for
taking the way

270
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,190
love being the packaging BD FL on
shoulders I have certainly disagree with

271
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,370
in the past but he is the hero Gotham
needs

272
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,940
and finally our sponsors I just a quick
shout out to some response urs fastly

273
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,180
Rackspace dine

274
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,890
King Dom Pedro the DreamHost and
everyone else if I didn't get you into

275
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,710
my slide notes

276
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,730
without them we wouldn't be able to run
heiii or any of our other PSS services

277
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:01,730
so a big thank you to all of our
sponsors and thank you

278
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,620
and it has the questions

279
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,310
you could just go to Microcenter make
sure you step toward Mike could you

280
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,560
actually go back to Donald slide cuz
he's on our team. I wanted to get a

281
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,810
picture that to santo

282
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,050
thank you know as a

283
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,610
frequent power up library perpetrator I
wonder should I upload

284
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,860
Estes and wheels now yes you should
definitely still be uploading assests

285
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,450
will be

286
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,630
a long time before everyone's installers
are updated sport wheels

287
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,180
so legacy is legacy and there's no
downside uploading both something sports

288
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,680
we'll

289
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,070
will use real and life will be great and
otherwise you get status quo

290
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,670
could be worse I you mention that you're
going to be doing some improvements to

291
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,710
the lawn Xabi

292
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,310
tagging are can you give us any teasers
about what that might look like

293
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,810
is it going to be partly for 25 hours is
just in the air at this point

294
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,380
it's very much in the air there's a lot
of competing discussions about how best

295
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,210
to handle it

296
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,480
and I don't feel qualified to report on
those

297
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,940
in my preparations for pie thompson's
like I said above the organizers I've

298
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,180
been a little bit analyst for about two
weeks now

299
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,320
which is a long time these days which
trickle

300
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,810
that's that's a long time the world
packaging hi

301
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,930
do you know if there are any plans for
virtual improper

302
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:22,120
to become part of the standard library I
don't think so nor have I heard any

303
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,560
desire expressed on the part of the
march on proper authors

304
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,140
stuff ending up in the Central Library
drastically limits its ability to

305
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,080
to change and evolve over time so its it
is a mixed blessing

306
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,400
a virtual unfortunately was stable and
often did exactly one thing to do with

307
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,690
that was so it's not really big deal but
virtually rappers that myself growing

308
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,260
cell

309
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,240
not sure that would really be dust so I
just checked and evidence

310
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,850
still has incher disabled and 2.4

311
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,150
their three per package do you know if
there's plans to

312
00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:00,310
reinstate that there's a fix Nikon but
so areas waving his hand

313
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,410
so so the I I kind of lost a little bit

314
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,620
the deal is that the end goal is that

315
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,800
if you install python 3.4 you get insure
paper is the way that we are supporting

316
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,089
that

317
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,240
for our sources traditions but the

318
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,430
the actual pet only specified that
people be available some

319
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:21,390
or distributors like Debbie and Red Hat
would prefer to not use interpret

320
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,339
because they want to continue

321
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,650
managed via their tooling so instead
most of them are changing the Python

322
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,350
virtual package to depend on the actual
fight on and on the pay package

323
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,390
so that they can continue the to like if
they have to do security releases or

324
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,390
certainly anyone that has the long-term
support releases can continue to use

325
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,700
their trolling for that

326
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,540
but you can still if you installed by
the way for and keep is not available

327
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,190
and working

328
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,970
it's about yet there is one thing with I
am

329
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,210
I don't know if it's been fixed but at
least when you called pay bien

330
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,990
it would fail because it couldn't find
incher there's an open Debian bug on

331
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,340
that

332
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,690
great thank you to questions

333
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,800
may be out at my ignorance with Kanda
but

334
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,510
a scientist at wills theoretically
should solve the problem of distributing

335
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,480
all that buying repeal trades so your ex
and

336
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,810
oh this is primarily for scientific
computing could you elaborate on these

337
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,240
will we need Kanda and what would be its
role these

338
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,460
distribution business I would certainly
love if Khan there was no longer

339
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,970
necessary book on the

340
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,280
does a lot more than just managing
haifong stuff

341
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,220
it's really designed to be are
installing work low tool for scientists

342
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,420
and number crunchers

343
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,890
but don't wanna know the details what
Python package even is

344
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,500
arledge wanna to push a couple buttons
and run something and they get

345
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,450
environments do their computing I would
certainly love it ends up being at that

346
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,770
point but like I said conder can also
install stuff it's not quite unrelated I

347
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,160
think

348
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,320
so I'm not sure that would really be in
scope

349
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,170
others definitely been talk at some
point francis conrad is a meditative

350
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:55,830
servers

351
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,910
we would love to eventually merge that
into warehouse so that it can be a

352
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,340
single ecosystem even if it's too
insular tools

353
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,730
and never got Mexican questions thank

354
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,490
what would you recommend to you

355
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,470
holes private packages to host private
packages and set up like pushing to pipe

356
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,330
I it's

357
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,620
de PI unequivocally it is the best tool

358
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,230
by leaps and bounds thanks thanks very
much

359
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,260
we have a little time for questions
going wants going to whites

360
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,300
okay kept on this time and

361
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,570
take now
